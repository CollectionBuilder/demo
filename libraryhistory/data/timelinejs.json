Surles, owned the land and structure, which he provided for use as a library in the late 1930s. On account of the small size of the structure, only one person (or two if small children) could use the library at a time. Children would wait in line for their turn in the library. According to an article in the Dec. 23, 1939, issue of The State Magazine, the citizens of Proctorville started up the library with donations from the community, initially acquiring a collection of 400 books. The author contends that “Proctorville is the smallest town in the United States which possesses a full time public librarian, which it does with the aid of the P.W.A.” (P.W.A. may possibly stand for Public Works Administration or be a typo of W.P.A) The librarian’s name was evelyn Singletary Clyburn. The P.W.A. (or possibly WPA?) ceased to provide support circa 1941, and since that time the library has been maintained and operated by volunteers from the Proctorville Book Club. A more permanent brick structure replaced the former hot dog stand during the 1950s. This current library building is named the “W.R. Surles Memorial Library,” as Surles bequeathed money to build the structure. It's open on Thursday afternoons."

Indeed, the early forties were banner years as far as the Stanford L. Warren Public Library (so named in honor of its primary benefactor) was concerned. The new library contained a children's room, and librarian Selena Wheeler initiated a Saturday morning story hour in 1940, which proved so effective and popular that the library sponsored a Storytelling Institute the next year. On Wheeler's advice, the library also designated its collection of books on and by African Americans as a noncirculating, special collection during this period. The library made special arrangements with local book sellers to purchase books by African-American authors at a reduced price. In 1942, Wheeler convinced the Board to use the Hattie B. Wooten Browsing Room to house the collection and subsequently did much to expand and classify the collection. Over time, with the addition of many rare and out-of-print books, the collection became one of the best of its kind in the state."

Driven by librarian Selena Wheeler, it traversed the countryside, covering 575 miles each month, and was well received by rural communities. One woman served the staff her country cooking and another, in order to make a good impression, cleaned her house the day the bookmobile was expected. Very often the librarians had to assure potential patrons that there was no charge to borrow books, the most popular of which were fiction and religious."

It was organized and has been maintained by a club of young people of the town being supported by contributions, public entertainments, and the payment of one dollar yearly dues by the members. It has been open free [underlined] to the public ever since organized. And it contains one thousand and nineteen volumes including encyclopedias histories fiction +c. The usefulness of this institution is attended by the extensive way it is patronized by the town and surrounding neighborhood. I should be glad to know more about the North Carolina Library Association and how to become a member. Very Sincerely, (Miss) Lily Rankin\""

Virginia Deaton retired in 1978 with over 35 years of service. The bookmobile itself was built by the Moroney Company and cost $8,319.50. It replaced the old one which had been used for the past nine years.  The bookmobile was one of only two made by the Mornoney Company with the other being a smaller vehicle in Plymouth.  The new bookmobile housed 2,000 books.  It had two heaters, one of which is run off the engine, and the other run off bottled gas.  Lighting and electric fans were operated by an auxiliary battery which was recharged nightly.  An identical model of the new bookmobile was shown in 1959 at the American National Exhibit in Russia."
