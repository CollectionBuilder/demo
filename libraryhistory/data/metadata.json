        "description": "Three young African-American children carrying schoolbooks (&quot;Essentials of Everyday English&quot;) stand looking into the display window of the Market Street Branch Library in the YMI building in Asheville.  The library branch, first called the &quot;Colored Library,&quot; opened in 1927 on South Market Street.  The name was changed to Market Street Branch of City Libraries in 1951. The branch moved to another part of the YMI building, facing Eagle Street, in 1959. That branch closed in 1966, following the desegregation of the library system in 1962.  Window is stenciled: &quot;Colored Public Library - Hrs 9-12, 2-6.&quot; The subject of the window display is China, with plants, dolls, newspapers, and books. The names of the children are (left to right) Spencer White, Frank Owens Jr., and Dorothy Owens. They were students at the Shiloh Elementary School in Asheville at the time this photo was taken.",

        "description": "The library structure was originally a hot dog stand operated by Harry Lewis. Lewis’s grandfather, W.R. Surles, owned the land and structure, which he provided for use as a library in the late 1930s. On account of the small size of the structure, only one person (or two if small children) could use the library at a time. Children would wait in line for their turn in the library. According to an article in the Dec. 23, 1939, issue of The State Magazine, the citizens of Proctorville started up the library with donations from the community, initially acquiring a collection of 400 books. The author contends that “Proctorville is the smallest town in the United States which possesses a full time public librarian, which it does with the aid of the P.W.A.” (P.W.A. may possibly stand for Public Works Administration or be a typo of W.P.A) The librarian’s name was evelyn Singletary Clyburn. The P.W.A. (or possibly WPA?) ceased to provide support circa 1941, and since that time the library has been maintained and operated by volunteers from the Proctorville Book Club. A more permanent brick structure replaced the former hot dog stand during the 1950s. This current library building is named the “W.R. Surles Memorial Library,” as Surles bequeathed money to build the structure. It's open on Thursday afternoons.",

Indeed, the early forties were banner years as far as the Stanford L. Warren Public Library (so named in honor of its primary benefactor) was concerned. The new library contained a children's room, and librarian Selena Wheeler initiated a Saturday morning story hour in 1940, which proved so effective and popular that the library sponsored a Storytelling Institute the next year. On Wheeler's advice, the library also designated its collection of books on and by African Americans as a noncirculating, special collection during this period. The library made special arrangements with local book sellers to purchase books by African-American authors at a reduced price. In 1942, Wheeler convinced the Board to use the Hattie B. Wooten Browsing Room to house the collection and subsequently did much to expand and classify the collection. Over time, with the addition of many rare and out-of-print books, the collection became one of the best of its kind in the state.",

Matthew B. Mitchell stands at rear door with Annie M Tucker to his left. The Stanford L. Warren Public Library bookmobile made its first trip on February 10, 1942. Its revolving shelves held 600 books. Driven by librarian Selena Wheeler, it traversed the countryside, covering 575 miles each month, and was well received by rural communities. One woman served the staff her country cooking and another, in order to make a good impression, cleaned her house the day the bookmobile was expected. Very often the librarians had to assure potential patrons that there was no charge to borrow books, the most popular of which were fiction and religious.",

        "description": "In 1926, a group of African-American Wilmingtonians asked if they could use the Wilmington Public Library. They were denied and within a few months they raised enough money to start their own library at Giblem Masonic Hall. The public libraries were segregated until the 1960s. The first library cards were offered to African-Americans in 1960 and the two library budgets combined in 1963.

        "description": "In 1956, the Wilmington Public Library moved to the Wilmington Light Infantry Building. It was an unusual building, with marble walls, that had originally been the home of a wealthy Wilmington entrepreneur. The WLI gave the building its militaristic look by adding cannons to the roof. The building converted nicely to a library but by the 1970s the building was overflowing with library materials. The contraction of a new jail next door literally cracked the walls and plans were made for a new library building.

The building was finished in 1951, but need was so great an addition was completed by 1953.  The portrait seen in the far end of the room through the door in the center of the photograph is of Burton Craige, native son of Salisbury and library benefactor.  This room was repurposed as meeting space when a larger expansion of the library was made in 1989.",

It was organized and has been maintained by a club of young people of the town being supported by contributions, public entertainments, and the payment of one dollar yearly dues by the members. It has been open free [underlined] to the public ever since organized. And it contains one thousand and nineteen volumes including encyclopedias histories fiction +c. The usefulness of this institution is attended by the extensive way it is patronized by the town and surrounding neighborhood. I should be glad to know more about the North Carolina Library Association and how to become a member. Very Sincerely, (Miss) Lily Rankin\"",

        "full text": "· Why Does Caldwell County Need A New Library?    The present Library facilities are woefully inadequate. There is such a shortage of space that    as new books come in, old ones have to be removed to make room. There is no place for the Librar­ians    to process the books.    Perhaps the worst feature of the present Library is the location on the top floor of the Agri­cultural    Building, reached by a long flight of very steep steps. Many older people who would like    to use the Library are unable to do so because of the steps.    Furthermore, there is a serious parking problem at the present location - for the Library    staff, the Bookmobiles, and for people borrowing books.    Why Doesn't The County Build A New Library?    According to law, the County Commissioners cannot use tax money for building purposes un­less    such money is derived from a tax levy for a specific bUilding program. Regular tax funds can    be used only for the running expense of the Library. So the only money the County can give to­ward    a building program is that which has been derived from other than tax sources.    How Much Will A New Library Cost?    The Library Board working with the County Commissioners and architects have estima~ the    cost of an adequate Library at $ 125,000.00. Of this amount, $ 100,000.00 has already been promised    by the County, the manufacturers of Caldwell County, and the Lenoir Service League. Also, a val­uable    building site on the northwest comer of East College Avenue and Norwood Street has been    donated.    There remains only $ 25,000.00 to be raised by the individuals of Caldwell County.    How Does The Library Serve The People Of Caldwell County?    The MAIN LIBRARY provides everything from pre- school age. picture l100ks through adult    reading of every type. There is also available:    Books for special interests- gardening, interior decoration, religion, travel, and hundreds    of other SUbjects    ij. eference books for students    Magazines, new and old, completely indexed for years back    Sound movies and sound projectors    Records and record players    The BOOKMOBILES serve every school and every community in the County. The libraries at    the school are kept well stocked by the Bookmobiles, and many stops are made at private homes to    leave books for an entire neighborhood.    SUMMER READING CLUBS for boys and girls. Books are provided either by' the main Library    or the Bookmobiles, records are kept of the number of books read by each chifd, and prizes are    given at the end of the summer.",

She was hired as the bookmobile driver in 1942 with her salary being paid by the County Board of Education since WPA funding had been discontinued in May of that year. Virginia Deaton retired in 1978 with over 35 years of service. The bookmobile itself was built by the Moroney Company and cost $8,319.50. It replaced the old one which had been used for the past nine years.  The bookmobile was one of only two made by the Mornoney Company with the other being a smaller vehicle in Plymouth.  The new bookmobile housed 2,000 books.  It had two heaters, one of which is run off the engine, and the other run off bottled gas.  Lighting and electric fans were operated by an auxiliary battery which was recharged nightly.  An identical model of the new bookmobile was shown in 1959 at the American National Exhibit in Russia.",

In October 1913, it was moved to the Mission House Reading Room on Main Street in Blowing Rock. Mrs. Carter worked with Reverend William Savage (episcopal minister in Blowing Rock from 1902-1917) in raising several hundred dollars for the construction of the building. The Mary Nelson Carter Memorial Library fell into disuse after Reverend Savage was reassigned to Virginia Beach. In 1918, a local resident collected a number of the books from the floor of the Mission House, ultimately preventing their destruction in the building's 1923 fire. These few books, augmented by small private donations, were all that remained of the Lend-A-Hand Library. In September of 1928, an anonymous benefactor donated about six hundred volumes to the library. Blowing Rock's Community Club helped finance the purchase of 1,000 more books. The Community Club decided to share this bounty with the local school, and on November 13, 1928, the Blowing Rock Community and School Library held its grand opening.",
