According to an article in the Dec. 23, 1939, issue of The State Magazine, the citizens of Proctorville started up the library with donations from the community, initially acquiring a collection of 400 books. The author contends that “Proctorville is the smallest town in the United States which possesses a full time public librarian, which it does with the aid of the P.W.A.” (P.W.A. may possibly stand for Public Works Administration or be a typo of W.P.A) The librarian’s name was evelyn Singletary Clyburn. The P.W.A. (or possibly WPA?) ceased to provide support circa 1941, and since that time the library has been maintained and operated by volunteers from the Proctorville Book Club. A more permanent brick structure replaced the former hot dog stand during the 1950s. This current library building is named the “W.R.

The Mary Nelson Carter Memorial Library fell into disuse after Reverend Savage was reassigned to Virginia Beach. In 1918, a local resident collected a number of the books from the floor of the Mission House, ultimately preventing their destruction in the building's 1923 fire. These few books, augmented by small private donations, were all that remained of the Lend-A-Hand Library. In September of 1928, an anonymous benefactor donated about six hundred volumes to the library. Blowing Rock's Community Club helped finance the purchase of 1,000 more books.
