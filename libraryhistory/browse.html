On account of the small size of the structure, only one person (or two if small children) could use the library at a time. Children would wait in line for their turn in the library. According to an article in the Dec. 23, 1939, issue of The State Magazine, the citizens of Proctorville started up the library with donations from the community, initially acquiring a collection of 400 books. The author contends that “Proctorville is the smallest town in the United States which possesses a full time public librarian, which it does with the aid of the P.W.A.” (P.W.A. may possibly stand for Public Works Administration or be a typo of W.P.A) The librarian’s name was evelyn Singletary Clyburn. The P.W.A. (or possibly WPA?) ceased to provide support circa 1941, and since that time the library has been maintained and operated by volunteers from the Proctorville Book Club. A more permanent brick structure replaced the former hot dog stand during the 1950s. This current library building is named the “W.R. Surles Memorial Library,” as Surles bequeathed money to build the structure. It's open on Thursday afternoons.",  "cdm":"104", "id":"libraryhistory104" },

The new library contained a children's room, and librarian Selena Wheeler initiated a Saturday morning story hour in 1940, which proved so effective and popular that the library sponsored a Storytelling Institute the next year. On Wheeler's advice, the library also designated its collection of books on and by African Americans as a noncirculating, special collection during this period. The library made special arrangements with local book sellers to purchase books by African-American authors at a reduced price. In 1942, Wheeler convinced the Board to use the Hattie B. Wooten Browsing Room to house the collection and subsequently did much to expand and classify the collection.

The present Library facilities are woefully inadequate. There is such a shortage of space that    as new books come in, old ones have to be removed to make room. There is no place for the Librar­ians    to process the books.    Perhaps the worst feature of the present Library is the location on the top floor of the Agri­cultural    Building, reached by a long flight of very steep steps. Many older people who would like    to use the Library are unable to do so because of the steps.    Furthermore, there is a serious parking problem at the present location - for the Library    staff, the Bookmobiles, and for people borrowing books.    Why Doesn't The County Build A New Library?    According to law, the County Commissioners cannot use tax money for building purposes un­less    such money is derived from a tax levy for a specific bUilding program. Regular tax funds can    be used only for the running expense of the Library. So the only money the County can give to­ward    a building program is that which has been derived from other than tax sources.    How Much Will A New Library Cost?    The Library Board working with the County Commissioners and architects have estima~ the    cost of an adequate Library at $ 125,000.00. Of this amount, $ 100,000.00 has already been promised    by the County, the manufacturers of Caldwell County, and the Lenoir Service League. Also, a val­uable    building site on the northwest comer of East College Avenue and Norwood Street has been    donated.    There remains only $ 25,000.00 to be raised by the individuals of Caldwell County.    How Does The Library Serve The People Of Caldwell County?    The MAIN LIBRARY provides everything from pre- school age. picture l100ks through adult    reading of every type. There is also available:    Books for special interests- gardening, interior decoration, religion, travel, and hundreds    of other SUbjects    ij. eference books for students    Magazines, new and old, completely indexed for years back    Sound movies and sound projectors    Records and record players    The BOOKMOBILES serve every school and every community in the County. The libraries at    the school are kept well stocked by the Bookmobiles, and many stops are made at private homes to    leave books for an entire neighborhood.    SUMMER READING CLUBS for boys and girls. Books are provided either by' the main Library    or the Bookmobiles, records are kept of the number of books read by each chifd, and prizes are    given at the end of the summer.",  "cdm":"1255", "id":"libraryhistory1255" },

Mrs. Carter worked with Reverend William Savage (episcopal minister in Blowing Rock from 1902-1917) in raising several hundred dollars for the construction of the building. The Mary Nelson Carter Memorial Library fell into disuse after Reverend Savage was reassigned to Virginia Beach. In 1918, a local resident collected a number of the books from the floor of the Mission House, ultimately preventing their destruction in the building's 1923 fire. These few books, augmented by small private donations, were all that remained of the Lend-A-Hand Library. In September of 1928, an anonymous benefactor donated about six hundred volumes to the library. Blowing Rock's Community Club helped finance the purchase of 1,000 more books.
