Finally, Cornero relented and was arrested, and the ship's gambling operations shut down. (Based on research by James Harris)",

This photo was taken in 1953 around the time that Polos changed the name of the restaurant to The Sea Lion Inn. The establishment went through several renovations on this spot over the ensuing decades--due to either expansion or fire. In 1996, this site opened as Duke's Malibu restaurant.

This postcard is from the early 1950s around the time that Polos changed the name of the restaurant to The Sea Lion Inn.

Opened in 1894 and operated by the Southern Pacific Railroad Company, the wharf stretched a record-breaking 4,600 feet (nearly a mile) out into the bay and featured a double-tracked railroad line. However, by 1897, San Pedro had emerged as the site of Los Angeles harbor, and shipping closed at the Long Wharf by 1913. It was dismantled by 1920. It stood just north of Santa Monica Canyon at present-day Will Rogers State Beach. Printed on reverse: This photograph shows the view down Santa Monica Canyon to the ocean and the Long Wharf. The buildings are the early bathhouses and stores that served the tourists who came from Santa Monica and Los Angeles to enjoy the beach. The mesa on the right became the Huntington Palisades.

We have had a good week with Rachel & family, and the weather has been warm & sunny. We haven't really done anything special so far, as everyone has been at work or at school. On Thursday we went to an open evening at Rosemont Middle School where the children will be going in Sept. Its about 3 miles from here, so they won't be able to walk. We haven't been to Malibu this visit, it's a little way from here. With love from us all. Ernie & Ann\"",

Opened in 1894 and operated by the Southern Pacific Railroad Company, the wharf stretched a record-breaking 4,600 feet (nearly a mile) out into the bay and featured a double-tracked railroad line. However, by 1897, San Pedro had emerged as the site of Los Angeles harbor, and shipping closed at the Long Wharf by 1913. It was dismantled by 1920. It stood just north of Santa Monica Canyon at present-day Will Rogers State Beach.",

Her mysterious death in her garage above the Cafe a year later shocked and intrigued the public. After her death, the Cafe continued operating under her name for some years afterward.
