Cram, a Union soldier who fought in Sherman&#x27;s Army during the Civil War, returned home in 1867 to Evanston, Illinois to begin a map and atlas company with his uncle, Rufus Blanchard. By 1875, Cram owned his own publishing company in Chicago and soon rose to success by using a wax engraving process (such as perfected by the Rand McNally Company, his greatest competitor). Invented in 1834 by Richard Cary Morse and Henry A. Munson, the wax engraving process--also known as &quot;cerography&quot;--was not patented until 1848. This allowed for many engravers to perfect their own version of the method. Among them was the Rand McNally Co., which began printing maps in 1872, using a combination of Morse&#x27;s wax process and electrotyping. Invented in Russia, 1839 by a German named Jacobi, electrotyping took wax engraving one step further by coating the surface with a substance such as graphite (electrically conductive) and then submerging it all into an electrolytic bath and copper coating. When ready, the wax was then removed and the copper plate became the template for printing. While of less quality than lithography, it also cost less. By the 1890s most American publishing houses used this wax process. Cram retired in 1921, selling out to the National Map Company. In 1928, the company returned to the Cram name and it has continued in business to this day.","Washington (State)--Maps; Railroads--Washington (State)--Maps", "/demo/wsu-maps/items/maps33.html" ],

In 1852, a group of farmers met at Cowlitz Prairie (northeast of Astoria) to discuss the formation of the Territory of Washington. Citing distance and a feeling of isolation from the Oregon territorial government based in the Willamette Valley, the Cowlitz coalition persuaded Congress to approve the new government in 1853. While Oregon was granted statehood in 1859, Washington would not formally join the Union until 1889. The new territory&#x27;s boundaries included the Columbia River in the south, the 49th parallel in the north, and the Rocky Mountains in the east.This meant that it spread through parts of what is now Wyoming, Idaho and Montana. Much of the geographical information of this area used by contemporary mapmakers came from the expeditions of John C. Fremont and the Wilkes Expedition in the early 1840s. However, another major source of land routes came from the Pacific Railway Surveys of 1853--completed by the first Governor of the Territory of Washington, Isaac I. Stevens. The proposed railroad route is visible on this map, and so perhaps publisher J.H. Colton used Steven&#x27;s findings as a source as well. Inspired by the Wilkes expedition and the travels of John C. Fremont, many settlers journeyed to Oregon Territory during the Great Migration of 1843. Just three years later, the Oregon Treaty would place the Pacific Northwest boundary between U.S. and Great Britain at the 49th Parallel. By 1853, Oregon farmers north of the Columbia River pushed Congress to create the Territory of Washington. Its original boundaries are distinguished on this map, separating it from Oregon (which was defined a territory in 1848 and would become a state in 1859) and sprawling throughout the entire region now known as Idaho, and even parts of Montana and Wyoming. New York publisher J.H. Colton&#x27;s maps at this time were lithographs derived from steel plates. The colors are applied by hand.","Northwest, Pacific--Maps", "/demo/wsu-maps/items/maps101.html" ],

Pierre John DeSmet, established a mission with the Flathead Indians of the Bitterroot Valley near present day Missoula, Montana on September 24, 1841. Having gained the respect and friendship of many neighboring tribes, in 1845 DeSmet confidently set out on a mission of peace to act as mediator between the Flatheads and their traditional foe, the Blackfoot Nation (located further east in Montana). Ever the explorer, his route took him much farther north than necessary, via the Kootenai and Vermillion Rivers, across the Continental Divide, then north to the Saskatchewan River and the Canadian Rockies. Unable to locate the Blackfeet before the onset of winter, DeSmet and his party postponed their search and wintered as guests at Fort Edmonton. Located on the North Saskatchewan River at latitude 53-30` north, near present day Edmonton in Alberta Province, Canada, Fort Edmonton (also known at that time as Fort Augustus) was the headquarters of the district lying between the Athabasca and Saskatchewan Rivers. The secondary forts within the area included Jasper House, Fort Little Slave Lake, Fort Assiniboin, and Rocky Mountain House--among others. All of these forts mentioned are visible on DeSmet&#x27;s map, perhaps a project drawn during the two winter months he sojourned there. He also visited Fathers Thibault and Bourassa at St. Anne&#x27;s Mission, located some forty miles west of Fort Edmonton. Note the lake nearby, named after Fr. Thibault. While DeSmet&#x27;s stay was a pleasant visit, he was nonetheless anxious to return to the Flatheads, and perhaps continue his search for the Blackfeet. He decided not to wait for the snow melt, and left March 12, 1846. Pushing northwest on the only trail open, DeSmet traveled approximately one hundred miles to Fort Assiniboin on the Athabasca River. Still solid ice, DeSmet traversed the river route via a sledge drawn by four malamute dogs. From Fort Assiniboin, he persisted 250 miles upstream to Jasper House, reaching the fort on March 28th. By the end of April he descended south, crossing the mountains and walking nearly 70 miles on snowshoes. Hitching a ride down the Columbia River in a canoe owned by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, DeSmet reached Ft. Colville, (a short trip west of St. Mary&#x27;s, his Flathead Mission), on May 30, 1846.","Missions--Washington (State)--Maps, Manuscript; Alberta--Maps, Manuscript; Montana--Maps, Manuscript; Fr.

Pierre Jean DeSmet, traveled to the Pacific Northwest upon request by the Flathead Indian nation. Returning the next year with supplies and a few fellow brethren, DeSmet founded St. Mary&#x27;s Mission on the St. Joseph River, thirty miles north of present day Missoula, Montana. DeSmet then spent ten (nonconsecutive) years in the northwest region. In those years he baptized thousands of Indians, wrote extensively of his travels, hardships and triumphs, and drew maps of the area. In a letter sent back east, he describes his attempt at map-making: &quot;...I occupied myself occasionally in drawing maps of the countries through which I passed. I availed myself of the best information I could obtain from trappers and intelligent Indians who were well acquainted with the mountain passes and the course of the rivers. Not having had instruments with me, the maps were only an approximation to the true positions.&quot; St. Mary&#x27;s (spelled by DeSmet as &quot;Marie&#x27;s&quot;) is presented in the lower left corner of the map. The closest location for supplies lay at Fort Colville, 320 miles northwest, in eastern Washington. A number of Indians lived near the fort, including those from the Okinakane (Okanogan), Skoyelpi, Chaudiere (Kettle), and Sinpoil nations. St. Paul&#x27;s, a mission established near Fort Colville, administered to these nations. Further east, DeSmet opened another mission for the Cree Indians, naming it St. Francis Regis. South of this mission lay the Spokane River and the Zingomene (Spokane) people. Further east down the Spokane River lay the Sacred Heart Mission, built for the Pointed Hearts, or Coeur d&#x27;Alene Indians. Traveling north, thirty miles from the mouth of the Clark River, DeSmet began to lay the foundation for the Pend d&#x27;Oreilles&#x27; mission, which he christened St. Ignatius in 1844. North of this location is the Kootenai River and the land of the Kootenai and Arcs-a-plats (Flatbow) Indians. Note the holy cross symbol drawn by DeSmet on the Kootenai River in the center of this map. It was at this site in August 1845 that DeSmet and the Arcs-a-plats tribe erected a cross for the Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Further north along the Kootenai River, DeSmet marked other sites with such crosses--such as the St. Coeur d&#x27;Marie and De la Nativitie--where Father DeSmet also held mass. In this area, DeSmet has also located spots where he discovered high levels of gold and other &quot;minerales&quot;. DeSmet told no one of these findings, correctly fearing the swarm of settlers that would overtake this land once word of it became known. At the top of this map, to the left of the cross dated &quot;1845&quot; is a small stream DeSmet named &quot;Morigeau&quot;. A lone Canadian living with his native family in the wilderness, DeSmet came across Mr. Morigeau while journeying to the Canadian Rockies in search of the Blackfeet nation. All of these occurrences are described in his many letters to friends and family, both in Europe and the eastern United States.","Missions--Washington (State)--Maps, Manuscript; Missions--Idaho--Maps, Manuscript; Missions--Montana--Maps, Manuscript", "/demo/wsu-maps/items/maps155.html" ],

Invented in 1834 by Richard Cary Morse and Henry A. Munson, the wax engraving process--also known as &quot;cerography&quot;--was not patented until 1848. This allowed for many engravers to perfect their own version of the method. Among them was the Rand McNally Co., which began printing maps in 1872, using a combination of Morse&#x27;s wax process and electrotyping. Invented in Russia, 1839 by a German named Jacobi, electrotyping took wax engraving one step further by coating the surface with a substance such as graphite (electrically conductive) and then submerging it all into an electrolytic bath and copper coating. When ready, the wax was then removed and the copper plate became the template for printing. While of less quality than lithography, it also cost less. By the 1890s most American publishing houses used this wax process. Cram retired in 1921, selling out to the National Map Company.

Mr. and Mrs. Daniel Staley (some records report that it was David Staley), purposely platted the town in the hopes that its proximity to the Northern Pacific Railroad line would ensure its success. Nine miles west of Colfax on Rebel Flat, Mr. Q. Diamond platted a town and named it after himself circa 1886. The Columbia and Palouse Railroad (later sold to Union Pacific) ran through Rebel Flat. The town school, begun in the 1890s, consolidated with Colfax by 1938 and the post office closed in 1956.","Colton (Wash.)--Maps; Staley (Wash.)--Maps; Diamond (Wash.)--Maps; Whitman County (Wash.)--Maps;", "/demo/wsu-maps/items/maps270.html" ],

Of the five platted towns, only Endicott and Almota grew to any significance. In 1909 the Milwaukee Road, a part of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad, held an auction in Spokane for land at five locations along their tracks. Among them was Pandora. It lay eight miles north of Oakesdale, in the Pine Creek Valley. The C.M.S.P RR also named the town of Revere--located 30 miles northwest of Colfax--after Paul Revere. Some people already lived in the area prior to the coming of the C.M.P.S., and even a school was established in 1910. Much less information is available, however, for the C.M.P.S. flag stop known as Palisade. It lay on the northeast side of Rock Lake and so at times was even called &quot;Rock Lake Station&quot; instead. Endicott was founded in 1882 by the Oregon Land and Improvement Co., and was named for William Endicott, Jr., a shareholder in the company. Prior to this name settlers from the confederacy called the area &quot;Rebel Flat&quot;. A number of German-Russians settled there during the years 1882-1907, buying land communally and splitting it among them. Almota, on the north side of the Snake River almost 40 miles above Clarkston, was early on used by Nez Perce Indians as a fishing site. &quot;Allamotin&quot;, &quot;Almotine&quot;, and even &quot;Alto Motin&quot; have been given as Nez Perce names for the area, meaning &quot;torchlight&quot; or &quot;moonlight fishing&quot;. Almota, soon became the trading/shipping center for all of Inland Empire, but lost some of its business when rail lines arrived in Colfax in 1883. The Oregon, Washington and Idaho Railroad and the Snake River Valley Railroad would not arrive in Almota until 1907.

The name Granite was at times given to the school district as well. (The school, begun on Drain Street in 1893, consolidated with Pullman in 1938). Chambers did not grow much and the post office--started in 1901--closed down just five years later. The small town of Hooper was named after early settler, Albert J. Hooper. However, he never owned land in the actual town, set up by the Oregon Railway and Navigation Co. He was honored by them because he had a good ranch nearby. The real founders of Hooper, the McGregor Brothers, came in 1888. They worked hard and eventually opened a store there in 1900 that remained in business for a long time after. Hooper lies on the east bank of the Palouse River. LaCrosse began as a post office station in 1892 and was at that time known as Dunlor. There are two stories regarding the naming of the town. The Oregon Railway &amp; Navigation Co. built a line from Riparia to LaCrosse in 1888. One of its surveyors hailed from LaCrosse, Wisconsin and so named the town. Another story says that the town is named after its numerous cross streets. Whichever story is correct, in 1896, the Post Office name was changed to match the town. The town did not incorporate until 1917, but chose 1899 settler, Harding Shobe, as its first mayor.

Under the Morrill Act of 1862, all states were granted land on which to develop a college focused on the advancement of agriculture. The 1877 Hatch Act added to this donation, by funding scientific research at these institutions for its dissemination to the general public. The goal for both was to raise the level of farming practices everywhere. Pullman, a town dominated by a wheat-growing economy, fought for and won the right to the land grant in 1892. Under the administration of its second president, E.A. Bryan (1893-1916), the first wave of extensive building took place on campus. The Mechanic Arts Building, a womens dormitory later called Stevens Hall, and the Administration Building on College Hill were constructed in 1895. The brick and granite Administration Building was home to labs, library, classrooms and an assembly hall. Trees originating from nearby Moscow Mountain were transplanted on campus during the first Arbor Day celebration in 1896, and a men&#x27;s dormitory, Ferry Hall, came in 1897. Science Hall (1900), located in what is now half of the Morrow Building, boasted labs and lecture rooms and even museums. By 1908 the Domestic Economy department grew in both stature and size to where it earned its own building, Van Doren Hall. This new building was joined that year by Bryan Hall, first called the Library and Assembly Hall, College Hall for recitation classes, and a number of farm buildings, a hydraulic lab, and a veterinary hospital wing. All of these buildings and more can be seen on this map. By June, 1917 the school held five colleges: Agriculture, Mechanical Arts and Engineering, Sciences and Arts, Veterinary Science, and Home Economics.

Much of the problem stemmed from the inability of transplanted trees and shrubs to thrive in their new environment--despite the best attempts of successive Horticulture Department heads. Even the students pitched in to help, annually planting trees on Arbor Day (many of which came from Moscow Mountain) and taking one day of the year for a campus clean-up session. However, not until around 1920 were professional landscape designers brought in for consultation on the problem. Improvements thereafter came swiftly and successfully, and a few respected firms, such as the authors of this 1937 landscape study--Morell &amp; Nichols, Inc. of Minneapolis, Minnesota--gained regular employment.

By 1950, WSC had developed into an institution claiming over five thousand students. Four major changes took place in the five years following the war. An increase in enrollment due to the G.I. Bill, caused an urgent need for temporary housing. The Army responded by donating a number of surplus living quarters and furniture left over from wartime cantonments. While other units were placed on campus elsewhere, the main area of growth sprung up along the boundary of the WSC golf course and were appropriately named North, East and South Fairway. Peacetime also signaled the arrival of a new president. E.O. Holland, following a stint of ill health, stepped down from the position he had held for three decades and took an advisory position in the library. He was replaced by Wilson M. Compton, who sought increased faculty satisfaction and student physical and mental well-being. The latter goal resulted in more campus activities, counseling services, and the construction of a student union building in 1951. Up until this time, students used the old women&#x27;s gymnasium, but that building was razed to make room for another major addition soon to arrive on campus--a state-of-the-art library. Plans for an improved library facility had been in the works since 1937. By the time funds became available after the war, it was apparent to all that an architectural &quot;monument&quot; as originally slated under the Holland administration would no longer suffice. With the appointment of Dr. G Donald Smith as library director, the designs were re-drafted to reflect modern needs. This meant not only space for microfilm and movies, but also the centralization of the library&#x27;s entire collection into one building. Before, the collections were held in a variety of short-term repositories beyond that of Bryan Hall because of lack of storage space. Among these included the Home Economics Building, the Women&#x27;s Gym and even the Rifle Range. On this map a building marked &quot;library storage&quot; attests to this practice. The improved library increased the viability of a competitive graduate program and, along with President Compton&#x27;s efforts to establish WSC as a center for technological and industrial advancement, easily placed the college in a position to obtain university status in 1959.","Washington State University--Maps; Pullman (Wash.)--Maps", "/demo/wsu-maps/items/maps286.html" ],

Removed from his office in 1873 and replaced by John A. Simms, Winans was known to have worked with a number of white settlers living in the Colville Valley to successfully petition the removal of the reservation from choice land on one side of the Columbia to barren highlands on the other side.","Colville Indian Reservation--Maps, Manuscript; Indians of North America--Washington Territory--Maps, Manuscript; Kettle Falls; Fort Colville; Cascade Mountains; Blue Mountains; Idaho Territory", "/demo/wsu-maps/items/maps294.html" ],

Their efforts stemmed from a desire to see the entire state in top production and farming communities everywhere in need of railroad shipping services. This map shows the Inland Empire and more importantly, the Columbia Basin Irrigation Project at one of its most crucial times of development. The Inland Empire consisted of eastern Washington, northern Idaho, and northeast Oregon from between the Cascade Mountains to the Rocky Mountains. Within it lay &quot;Big Bend&quot; country--the region farmers flocked to when Palouse land was no longer available. (On this map it is shaded a dark green) For this reason, Big Bend was also known as the &quot;Empire within an Empire&quot;. It held some 2,800,000 acres, of which half were irrigable, lying ninety miles from north to south and sixty miles east to west. The project was much too large for one railroad company or town, or other private investor to take handle. By 1919, a number of government agencies (both state and federal) reviewed irrigation plans for the area. Among the top three were the &quot;Gravity Plan&quot;, pushed by the city of Spokane and the Washington Water Power Company, the &quot;Pumping Plan&quot; proposed by Billy Clapp of Ephrata and supported by the surveys of Mr. James O&#x27;Sullivan, and the &quot;Wenatchee Lake Plan&quot;, originating with Wenatchee Valley booster, Mr. Rufus Woods and taken on by the Quincy Valley Water Users Association. The Wenatchee Lake Plan proposed a gravity canal built from Wenatchee Lake in the mountains down to the floor of the Quincy Valley and would only water 400,000 acres. The Pumping Plan involved the erection of a dam at Grand Coulee, giving water to an estimated 1,400,000 acres in the Big Bend country to its south. This map supported the Gravity Plan, which would build a low masonry dam on Pend Oreille River at Albeni Falls, Idaho and hold the waters at Pend Oreille Lake and Priest Lake, Idaho. The reservoir lay approximately forty miles from Spokane. The water would then be sent (by gravity) through a series of canals and tunnels, siphons and aqueducts--even lakes--until it reached the Big Bend country 130 miles below. This plan predicted water for the most amount of acres (1, 750,000) and was touted as economically feasible. Throughout the 1920s, a number of survey reports weighing the feasibility of both plans were given, and approved the gravity plan over the pumping plan. However, the Corps of Engineers&#x27; &quot;308 Report&quot; compiled by Major John S. Butler, was the first to approve of the Grand Coulee (pumping plan) venture. When used as evidence in the House of Representative&#x27;s hearing by the Committee on Irrigation and Reclamation, the tide had changed and the pumping plan was approved over the gravity plan. With this approval, in 1933 President Roosevelt signed for appropriation of funds made possible by the National Industrial Recovery Act and construction on the Grand Coulee Dam began soon after.","Northwest, Pacific--Maps; Washington (State)--Maps; Northwest, Pacific--Road Maps; Railroads--Northwest, Pacific--Maps; Columbia Basin Survey Commission; Butler, John S.; Corps of Engineers--308 Report; Woods, Rufus; Quincy Valley Water Users Association; Washington Water Company; Albeni Falls, Idaho; Priest Lake, Idaho", "/demo/wsu-maps/items/maps295.html" ],

Washington Agriculture College began in 1892, on the hills overlooking the fifteen year old, wheat-growing town of Pullman, Washington. A land-grant college funded by the Morrill Land Act of 1862, the school&#x27;s purpose was to educate Washington State farmers in the latest crop and animal husbandry practices and technological advances. This map of Washington State College (the school changed its name in 1905) shows what is today the center of campus. In 1892, the campus consisted of the two and a half story College Hall (shown here) which held the President&#x27;s office, classrooms and labs, a library and an assembly hall, a one story classroom building called &quot;the crib&quot;, a number of farm buildings, a workshop, and a five story, co-ed dorm. Within the next few years (1894-96) the school added the Mechanic Arts Hall, the Administration building, and a women&#x27;s dorm (later called Stevens Hall). Science Hall and Ferry Hall (a men&#x27;s dorm that had burned down in 1897) were constructed in 1899, with Morrill Hall coming sometime soon after. One of the programs to gain its own department building was the Domestic Economy program. Begun in 1903, the field gained such prominence that Van Doren Hall was built to hold its classrooms and dining facilities in 1908. Other early draws to the school were courses taught towards Veterinary Medicine and Pharmacist training. The veterinary hospital and hydraulics lab shown on this map were constructed in 1907. The building marked &quot;Auditorium and Library&quot; is Bryan Hall, designed by architect J.K. Dow and completed in 1909. It was named after the second president of the college--Enoch A.

A housing shortage in the years directly following the Second World War forced the college to recognize that it could no longer accept everyone. Resident veterans received first priority, followed by Washington residents with an acceptable grade point average. Faculty and staff also felt the housing shortage. A number of new homes were built on Military Hill and near the Finch Memorial Hospital to house employees. Students lived in temporary dorms previously used as US Army cantonments. They were shipped to the school and situated near the golf course. Known as North, South and East Fairway, a number of veterans lived in these buildings. The student union building in the center of campus on this map is not the same building used today. It was known as the TUB--or temporary union building--and was originally the women&#x27;s gymnasium. Students began to use the area as a community center sometime in the early 1940s. However, President Compton felt the need for a new, modern building to help unite the campus. The TUB was torn down and replaced with the Compton Union Building in 1951. The building&#x27;s dedication came shortly after his forced resignation--brought about by politics found within the Board of Regents at the time. Compton was replaced in 1952 by C.

The creek flows into the Yakima River, and at one time supplied salmon to a number of Native American fishing sites along its route. A number of settlers arrived in the region during the 1860s and 1870s. By 1871, the Ahtanum Creek was diverted through an irrigation ditch onto newly claimed farmlands and sped the growth of the town of North Yakima ( the name changed to Yakima in 1918) which incorporated in 1886. The Northern Pacific Railroad and Yakima Irrigation Company won right of way across the Yakima Indian Reservation (begun 1855) to construct an irrigation canal running through the reserved lands. The company&#x27;s first project was the Sunnyside Canal. While it managed to outlast the Panic of 1893, the canal had lost the financial backing of the Northern Pacific during this time. Lack of funds and poor regulatory practices forced the people of Franklin, Benton, Kittitas and Yakima Counties to request government intervention. The United States Reclamation Service--begun in 1902 to oversee water projects in the West--agreed to take over the &quot;Yakima Project&quot; in 1905. Within five years it had regulated use, built diversion dams, and extended the Sunnyside canal.

This Township (north half withdrawn from entry by &quot;E&quot; Dec. 11, 1906 for adjustment of Indian allotments.&quot; Some sections withdrawn for Colville Forest Reserve. The Colville Indian Reservation was set up in 1872 in northeast Washington. Just a few months later, following the discovery of gold in the area and upon settler&#x27;s insistence, President Grant signed an Executive Order that reduced the boundaries of the reservation in half. The Indians received the &quot;south half&quot; while the settlers kept the coveted &quot;north half&quot;. This map shows a section of the &quot;north half&quot; of the reservation lands. The federal government then opened the north half for mining entry in 1896. In reality, however, a number of settlers laid claim to the land, plowing fields and setting irrigation ditches--to the extent that in a very short time residents of the south half contended with water shortages. This intense migration continued and then surged in 1900, when the government officially opened the area to homesteads. With growth came serious concern over the welfare of the streams and forests of the region. While President Benjamin Harrison had signed in the Forest Service Act in 1891 to create forest reserves, only the Priest River Reserve (1897) in northeast Washington and northern Idaho had been established. By the presidential term of conservation-minded Theodore Roosevelt, pressure groups from around the country were against setting aside any more lands. A much needed agriculture appropriations bill even stipulated that no more lands could be reserved for this purpose. However, Roosevelt authorized the Colville Forest Reserve on March 1st, 1907--just before signing the ag bill. The Colville Forest Reserve originally held over 700,000 acres, but wording found within the 1906 Forest Homestead Act gave settlers previously living on land claims within the proposed forest acreage the right to remain on their property and the reserve was reduced consequently. Perhaps this map was drawn to locate such land claims. For more information on the development of the US Forest Service in general and the Colville National Forest in Particular, consult Craig E.

The town of Longview lies at the confluence of the Columbia and Cowlitz Rivers in western Washington, ninety miles from the Pacific Ocean. The town is a rare example of a privately funded city that was planned completely before any structure was put up or any resident lived there. It began out of the necessity of the Long-Bell Lumber Company to branch find a replacement timber source. By 1918, clear-cutting of Long-Bell lands in the south had completely used up this supply of timber. What they found was a section of old growth trees in 23,851 acres which they purchased from the Weyerhaeuser Corp. They added acreage in the surrounding area until the total rose to some 70,000 acres! The president of the company, Mr. Alexander Long, chose the Washington site for originally one, and then two mills as the acreage was added. Realizing that 14,000 workers would be needed to handle two mills and that these workers would require homes and a community, Long ordered a survey of the land in 1921. He then hired two veteran city planning professionals--George B. Kessler (of St. Louis) and Hare &amp; Hare (of Kansas City) to plan for a predicted population of 75,000. They did, and the town was finished in 1923. One of the housing developments, St. Helens Inn, is colored blue on this map. A row of five, two-story houses, the Inn boarded single men who worked for the mill. Longview incorporated in 1924, one year before this map was published.

Invented in 1834 by Richard Cary Morse and Henry A. Munson, the wax engraving process--also known as &quot;cerography&quot;--was not patented until 1848. This allowed for many engravers to perfect their own version of the method. Among them was the Rand McNally Co., which began printing maps in 1872, using a combination of Morse&#x27;s wax process and electrotyping. Invented in Russia, 1839 by a German named Jacobi, electrotyping took wax engraving one step further by coating the surface with a substance such as graphite (electrically conductive) and then submerging it all into an electrolytic bath and copper coating. When ready, the wax was then removed and the copper plate became the template for printing. While of less quality than lithography, it also cost less. By the 1890s most American publishing houses used this wax process. Cram retired in 1921, selling out to the National Map Company. In 1928, the company returned to the Cram name and it has continued in business to this day.","Washington (State)--Boundaries; Oregon--Maps; Rand McNally Co.; cerography; electrotyping; Morse, Richard Cary; Munson, Henry A.", "/demo/wsu-maps/items/maps315.html" ],

The first white visitors to Whitman County would have been members of the Lewis &amp; Clark expedition, in 1805. Whitman County was first settled in the 1860s, and gradually converted from a livestock based economy to agriculture in the 1870s. With the improvement in irrigation, in farming technologies, and in transportation technologies, Whitman county gradually become more and more firmly based in agriculture.

From page 71 of Cram&#x27;s unrivaled atlas of the world. George F. Cram, a Union soldier who fought in Sherman&#x27;s Army during the Civil War, returned home in 1867 to Evanston, Illinois to begin a map and atlas company with his uncle, Rufus Blanchard. By 1875, Cram owned his own publishing company in Chicago and soon rose to success by using a wax engraving process (such as perfected by the Rand McNally Company, his greatest competitor). Invented in 1834 by Richard Cary Morse and Henry A. Munson, the wax engraving process--also known as &quot;cerography&quot;--was not patented until 1848. This allowed for many engravers to perfect their own version of the method. Among them was the Rand McNally Co., which began printing maps in 1872, using a combination of Morse&#x27;s wax process and electrotyping. Invented in Russia, 1839 by a German named Jacobi, electrotyping took wax engraving one step further by coating the surface with a substance such as graphite (electrically conductive) and then submerging it all into an electrolytic bath and copper coating. When ready, the wax was then removed and the copper plate became the template for printing. While of less quality than lithography, it also cost less. By the 1890s most American publishing houses used this wax process. Cram retired in 1921, selling out to the National Map Company. In 1928, the company returned to the Cram name and it has continued in business to this day.","Washington (State)--Maps", "/demo/wsu-maps/items/maps319.html" ],

Statehood finally came about in 1890. Statehood had been far from inevitable, as anti-Mormon feeling (among other factors) had led to several pushes for northern Idaho to become part of Washington State, and also for south-western Idaho to become part of the State of Nevada. One supposition is that this never came about because the northerners and south-westerners both needed each other against the Mormons. Had either been allowed to leave, the Mormons would have gained political control of what remained of Idaho.

The name Pataha is a Nez Perce word that means &quot;bushy creek&quot;. The town incorporated in 1875, as more and more people began to settle there. It became a popular spot after the arrival of three economies: the shipping/transportation industry, winter wheat farming, and flour production. The Pataha-Alpowa stage line stopped in the town, and a shipping business running the Snake River was also established some time after. Prior to 1870, Pataha was mostly a cattle raising region, but soon prospered as a farming town with the introduction of a hearty strain of wheat. The future looked bright for Pataha until 1886. In that year the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company built a track running up to the town of Pomeroy and greatly improved transportation methods in the area. However, Pomeroy had long been Pataha City&#x27;s rival, and refused to extend the line into the next town. Pataha City withered away when more and more businesses and farmers switched from shipping transport to the rails.

Prior to 1899 and the publishing of the first historical sketch of the town by resident Judge Thomas Neill, pioneer stories listed D.G. McKenzie as the first white man to settle in the area. After Neill&#x27;s history, the notion crept into the historical record that it was in fact Mr. Bolin Farr who first settled and then platted ten acres for the townsite. Another discrepancy stated that Pullman was originally named &quot;Three Forks&quot;, after the nearby junction of two creeks and with the Palouse River. However, Lawrence Stark, archivist of Manuscripts, Archives and Special Collections at Washington State University&#x27;s Holland Library, suggests that this is merely the geographical name for the area on which the town of Pullman is situated, and not the original name of the actual town at all. He further disagrees with the likelihood that the town was named after Pullman Car Company President, George Pullman. Some facts regarding the early town are certain however, such as the its incorporation in 1888. The town lay originally on several hills, with today&#x27;s College Hill then known as &quot;Mechanic&#x27;s Hill&quot; and Military Hill then known as &quot;College Hill&quot;. The original College Hill Addition (1890) is the site of the first college to arrive in Pullman--a military school begun in 1891. Apparently, the military school was academically well regarded, and preferred even over the State land-grant school when it enrolled its first students in 1892. However, the military college burned down in early 1893, and with the growing State College in such close proximity, it seemed pointless to rebuild.

After the initial burst of construction by the Northern Pacific in 1870-1871 a faltering economy began to affect the Railroad, and by 1872 financial disaster had occurred and construction was halted. In 1873, the company failed in a financial panic. Between 1873 and 1875, the company was reorganized and refinanced, and earnings from the transportation of coal along existing routes allowed the company to keep its head above water and even turn a slight profit. In 1879, new financing was arranged, and work began along almost the entire route. The Northern Pacific&#x27;s transcontinental route was finally finished in 1883, nineteen years after the Congressional act which originally created it. The two other rail companies shown here were both partners with the Northern Pacific at this time. The Oregon Railway and Navigation had previously constructed its own tracks along the Columbia, and in 1880 the Northern Pacific achieved a temporary arrangement with them to use their tracks while constructing their own. Seeing his railroad&#x27;s demise in a competing Northern Pacific route, the President of the OR&amp;N, Henry Villard, conducted a successful takeover of the Northern Pacific. The Oregon and Transcontinental was created by Villard to facilitate the cooperative operation of the two railways.","Railroads--West (U.S.)--Maps; Railroad travel--Northwest, Pacific--Maps; Northern Pacific Railroad; Oregon Railway and Navigation Company; Washington Territory", "/demo/wsu-maps/items/maps358.html" ],

The Lake Chelan area was first settled in approximately 1886, and is renowned for its beauty and for its relative inaccessibility. It was proposed for National Park status as early as 1892, though private interests (settling, recreation, logging, and mining) always derailed these efforts. Though mining failed due to the difficulties involved in getting ores out of the area, the area became enormously popular for recreation. Anti-logging efforts in the 1950s and 1960s led to the creation of the Lake Chelan National Recreation Area and the North Cascades National Park (bordering the Lake Chelan NRA to the north) in 1968.","Chelan, Lake (Wash.)--Maps; Chelan National Forest (Wash.)--Homesites.", "/demo/wsu-maps/items/maps394.html" ],

Taking twenty acres from his own farm and platting it into a twenty five town lots in 1906, Ross also pointed the town toward the direction of incorporation and was its first and most earnest boosters. He drafted this map for use in its development. The town lay on the bank of the Okanogan River, about thirty miles north from its confluence with the Columbia River and about six miles north of the town of Okanogan. Also incorporated in 1907, Okanogan was Omak&#x27;s rival, particularly in the fight for County Seat when the position moved from Conconully in 1915. Okanogan won the seat, but both towns profited from the Conconully Dam Irrigation Project. The U.S. Reclamation Project began in 1907 and the dam was completed in 1910. When the irrigation canals were set in place within the next decade, the project watered over 10,000 acres in the vicinity of Okanogan and Omak.

The initial effect of this was to allow the government to remove large tracts of forest from public access entirely, but in 1897 an act was passed that allowed the government to manage these lands, and so at government discretion they were made available for logging, grazing, and other uses. The act was initially used to set aside land protecting watersheds, to preserve &#x27;recreational&#x27; forests, and to provide for a long-term renewable timber resource.","National parks and reserves--West (U.S.)--Maps; Forest reserves--West (U.S.)--Maps; Forests and forestry--Washington (State)--Maps", "/demo/wsu-maps/items/maps512.html" ],

Nevada&#x27;s rush to Statehood came about mostly due to the Union&#x27;s need of tax revenue from the extensive silver mines there to finance its actions in the Civil War. The expansion into the Arizona and Utah territories (moving the western Nevada border from 117 degrees west longitude to 114 degrees and south through Arizona along the Colorado) came about from the desire to place a strategically important pass, located just east of then sleepy Las Vegas on the Old Spanish Trail, inside incorporated United States territory, and outside of both Mormon and notoriously lawless Arizonan hands.","West (U.S.)--Maps; Indians of North America--Maps; Railroads--West (U.S.)--Maps", "/demo/wsu-maps/items/maps532.html" ],

Text from the verso: FOREST CONDITIONS OF THE SEATTLE QUADRANGLE. This land-classification sheet, representing the Seattle quadrangle, shows the area which at the time of survey, in 1894-95, was covered with woods, and the area estimated to contain timber of merchantable size and quantity, which, as defined by the practice in Washington, includes trees having a butt diameter of 20 inches or more, with a length below branches of at least 32 feet. It shows, furthermore, the portions of the quadrangle which have been cut over or culled for lumber or clearing, and the area which has been burned. As is seen, most, if not all, of these areas have, since the cutting and burning, commenced to become reforested. The areas naturally devoid of forests are also indicated. The total area of this quadrangle is 804 square miles. Of this the land area is estimated at 565 square miles, 239 square miles being occupied by Puget Sound and its arms and by Washington and Sammamish lakes and other smaller bodies of water. This land was formerly covered with forests of merchantable timber, with the exception of some 20 square miles of swamp lands in the valley of Snohomish River and at the head of Elliot Bay, near Seattle, which were naturally without forests. Of this timbered area of 545 square miles, there have been cut or culled for lumber, or cleared for settlement, not less than 330 square miles, and there have been burned 40 square miles. Thus, since settlement began in this region the timber has been destroyed on an area of 370 square miles, or two-thirds of the area formerly forested, leaving only 175 square miles in merchantable forests. On most of the land thus denuded timber is growing again, so that the wooded area, including all land on which wood is growing, comprises not less than 495 square miles, or 88 per cent of the entire land area. The areas not wooded consist of those naturally without forests, the sites and suburbs of the towns and cities, and the numerous little farms scattered over the quadrangle.The area covered with merchantable timber is estimated to contain 1,653,246,000 feet B.M. of fir, almost entirely red fir (Pseudotsuga taxifolia), and 783,299,000 feet B.M. of cedar, mainly Thuja plicata, a total of 2,436,475,000 feet B.M. The merchantable timber consists almost entirely of these two species, and more than two-thirds of it is red fir. The average stand of timber upon this area is about 22,000 feet per acre, a heavy stand even for this heavily timbered part of the country. This region, which is blessed with a heavy rainfall and a humid atmosphere, is especially favorable to tree growth, and wherever the forests have been destroyed the reproduction is rapid, and the species which succeed are usually identical with those destroyed.

This land classification sheet, representing the Tacoma quadrangle, shows the area which at the time of survey, in 1894-95, was covered with woods, and the areas containing timber of merchantable size and quality, which, as defined by the practice in Washington, includes trees having a butt diameter of 20 inches or more, with a length below branches of at least 32 feet. It shows, furthermore, the portions of the quadrangle which have been cut over or culled for lumber or clearing, and those which have been burned. As is seen, most of these areas have, since the cutting and burning, commenced to become reforested. The areas naturally devoid of forests are also indicated, including a few square miles at the head of Commencement Bay, a small area in the valley of White River, and a large area south of Tacoma. The last is an area of approximately level land, covered by coarse glacial deposits, in which the copious rainfall rapidly sinks, making it, to all intents and purposes, an arid soil. It is because of this feature of the soil that the region is largely open and park-like. It contains scattered groves of trees, largely composed of lodgepole pine, a species here of no merchantable value. The trees are of small size, and branch nearly to the ground. The total area of this quadrangle is 812 square miles. Of this the land area is approximately 737 square miles, the remainder being included in Puget Sound and a few small lakes. With the exception of the areas above mentioned which are naturally timberless or are covered with lodgepole pine, and which include about 105 square miles, the land area was formerly covered with forest of merchantable timber. Of this timbered area of 632 square miles, there have been cut or culled for lumber, or cleared for settlement, about 200 square miles, and there have been burned 143 square miles, leaving in standing merchantable timber only 289 square miles. Thus, since settlement began in this region, timber has been destroyed over an area of 343 square miles, or 54 per cent of the area formerly forested. On all the areas thus denuded timber is growing again, except where the land has been cultivated: so that the wooded area, including all lands on which wood is growing, comprises not less than 560 square miles, or 76 per cent of the land area of the quadrangle. The areas not now wooded consist not only of those naturally without forests, as above specified, but the sites and suburbs of the towns and cities and the numerous farms scattered over the quadrangle. The area covered with merchantable timber is estimated to contain the following amount, in feet B.M.: Red fir (Pseudotsuga taxifolia), 1,686,900,000 feet; spruce (Picea sitchensis), 5,447,000 feet; cedar (Thuja plicata), 374,397,000 feet; hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana), 22,429,000 feet; total, 2,089,173,000 feet. Four-fifths of the above amount of timber consists of red fir, and nearly all the remainder of cedar, the amount of spruce and hemlock being insignificant. The average stand of timber upon the timbered area of this quadrangle is but little over 11,000 feet B.M. per acre, a stand only about half as great as that of the Seattle quadrangle, immediately north of it. This region, lying in the Sound valley, at the head of that sheet of water, is blessed with an ample rainfall and a humid atmosphere, which are especially favorable to tree growth; so that wherever forests have been destroyed their reproduction is rapid, and the species which succeed are usually identical with those destroyed.

Though the military road was never fully completed to the north, Snohomish still became the major center of the area as a result of the crossing.

It transferred the next year three miles away to Pomeroy, Washington, but the fact that Pataha City held the honor even temporarily shows that the town was strong and growing at that point in time. The name Pataha is a Nez Perce word that means &quot;bushy creek&quot;. The town incorporated in 1875, as more and more people began to settle there. It became a popular spot after the arrival of three economies: the shipping/transportation industry, winter wheat farming, and flour production. The Pataha-Alpowa stage line stopped in the town, and a shipping business running the Snake River was also established some time after. Prior to 1870, Pataha was mostly a cattle raising region, but soon prospered as a farming town with the introduction of a hearty strain of wheat. The future looked bright for Pataha until 1886. In that year the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company built a track running up to the town of Pomeroy and greatly improved transportation methods in the area. However, Pomeroy had long been Pataha City&#x27;s rival, and refused to extend the line into the next town. Pataha City withered away when more and more businesses and farmers switched from shipping transport to the rails. The gristmill business (the Houser Mill or Pataha Flour Mill for example) continued on for a number of years due to a high international demand for its quality product. However, it too closed down by 1940, when the federal government placed costly and rigid regulations on small businesses.","Pataha City (Wash.)--Aerial views--Maps; Pataha City (Wash.)--Pictorial works", "/demo/wsu-maps/items/maps561.html" ],

This Treaty was a source of great disagreement among the Nez Perce- many opposed it, and many Chiefs refused to sign it. These non-signers would provide the basis for further difficulties, as many Nez Perce did not consider themselves bound by the Treaty, though the American government considered them to be so. The Indian argument was convincing enough that in 1873 President Grant restored to the Nez Perce the territory shown in yellow in addition to their pre-existing reservation (blue). The government soon revoked its own proclamation, however, and the Indians were ordered off the lands.

Before the arrival to Washington State of the first irrigation projects handled by the U.S. Reclamation Service, the Northern Pacific Railroad and other railway companies funded private irrigation projects in the Columbia River Basin. Their efforts stemmed from a desire to see the entire state in top production and farming communities everywhere in need of railroad shipping services. This map shows the Inland Empire and more importantly, the Columbia Basin Irrigation Project at one of its most crucial times of Empire consisted of eastern Washington, northern Idaho, and northeast Oregon from between the Cascade Mountains to the Rocky Mountains. Within it lay &quot;Big Bend&quot; country--the region farmers flocked to when Palouse land was no longer available. (On this map it is shaded a dark green) For this reason, Big Bend was also known as the &quot;Empire within an Empire&quot;. It held some 2,800,000 acres, of which half were irrigable, lying ninety miles from north to south and sixty miles east to west. The project was much too large for one railroad company or town, or other private investor to take handle. By 1919, a number of government agencies (both state and federal) reviewed irrigation plans for the area. Among the top three were the &quot;Gravity Plan&quot;, pushed by the city of Spokane and the Washington Water Power Company, the &quot;Pumping Plan&quot; proposed by Billy Clapp of Ephrata and supported by the surveys of Mr. James O&#x27;Sullivan, and the &quot;Wenatchee Lake Plan&quot;, originating with Wenatchee Valley booster, Mr. Rufus Woods and taken on by the Quincy Valley Water Users Association. The Wenatchee Lake Plan proposed a gravity canal built from Wenatchee Lake in the mountains down to the floor of the Quincy Valley and would only water 400,000 acres. The Pumping Plan involved the erection of a dam at Grand Coulee, giving water to an estimated 1,400,000 acres in the Big Bend country to its south. This map supported the Gravity Plan, which would build a low masonry dam on Pend Oreille River at Albeni Falls, Idaho and hold the waters at Pend Oreille Lake and Priest Lake, Idaho. The reservoir lay approximately forty miles from Spokane. The water would then be sent (by gravity) through a series of canals and tunnels, siphons and aqueducts--even lakes--until it reached the Big Bend country 130 miles below. This plan predicted water for the most amount of acres (1, 750,000) and was touted as economically feasible. Throughout the 1920s, a number of survey reports weighing the feasibility of both plans were given, and approved the gravity plan over the pumping plan. However, the Corps of Engineers&#x27; &quot;308 Report&quot; compiled by Major John S. Butler, was the first to approve of the Grand Coulee (pumping plan) venture. When used as evidence in the House of Representative&#x27;s hearing by the Committee on Irrigation and Reclamation, the tide had changed and the pumping plan was approved over the gravity plan. With this approval, in 1933 President Roosevelt signed for appropriation of funds made possible by the National Industrial Recovery Act and construction on the Grand Coulee Dam began soon after.

Before the arrival to Washington State of the first irrigation projects handled by the U.S. Reclamation Service, the Northern Pacific Railroad and other railway companies funded private irrigation projects in the Columbia River Basin. Their efforts stemmed from a desire to see the entire state in top production and farming communities everywhere in need of railroad shipping services. The project was much too large for one railroad company or town, or other private investor to take handle. By 1919, a number of government agencies (both state and federal) reviewed irrigation plans for the area. These were shortly resolved into two possibilities: the &quot;Gravity Plan&quot;, pushed by the city of Spokane and the Washington Water Power Company, and the &quot;Pumping Plan&quot; proposed by Billy Clapp of Ephrata and supported by the surveys of Mr. James O&#x27;Sullivan. The Pumping Plan involved the erection of a dam at Grand Coulee, giving water to an estimated 1,400,000 acres in the Big Bend country to its south. This map displayed the canal route of the Gravity Plan, which would build a low masonry dam on Pend Oreille River at Albeni Falls, Idaho and hold the waters at Pend Oreille Lake and Priest Lake, Idaho. The reservoir lay approximately forty miles from Spokane. The water would then be sent (by gravity) through a series of canals and tunnels, siphons and aqueducts--even lakes--until it reached the Big Bend country 130 miles below. This plan predicted water for the most amount of acres (1, 750,000) and was touted as economically feasible. Throughout the 1920s, a number of survey reports weighing the feasibility of both plans were given, and approved the gravity plan over the pumping plan. However, the Corps of Engineers&#x27; &quot;308 Report&quot; compiled by Major John S. Butler, was the first to approve of the Grand Coulee (pumping plan) venture.

Before the arrival to Washington State of the first irrigation projects handled by the U.S. Reclamation Service, the Northern Pacific Railroad and other railway companies funded private irrigation projects in the Columbia River Basin. Their efforts stemmed from a desire to see the entire state in top production and farming communities everywhere in need of railroad shipping services. The project was much too large for one railroad company or town, or other private investor to take handle. By 1919, a number of government agencies (both state and federal) reviewed irrigation plans for the area. Among the top three were the &quot;Gravity Plan&quot;, pushed by the city of Spokane and the Washington Water Power Company, the &quot;Pumping Plan&quot; proposed by Billy Clapp of Ephrata and supported by the surveys of Mr. James O&#x27;Sullivan, and the &quot;Wenatchee Lake Plan&quot;, originating with Wenatchee Valley booster, Mr. Rufus Woods and taken on by the Quincy Valley Water Users Association. The Wenatchee Lake Plan proposed a gravity canal built from Wenatchee Lake in the mountains down to the floor of the Quincy Valley and would only water 400,000 acres. The Pumping Plan involved the erection of a dam at Grand Coulee, giving water to an estimated 1,400,000 acres in the Big Bend country to its south. This map shows both the Gravity Plan and the Pumping Plan. Throughout the 1920s, a number of survey reports weighing the feasibility of both plans were given, and approved the gravity plan over the pumping plan. However, the Corps of Engineers&#x27; &quot;308 Report&quot; compiled by Major John S. Butler, was the first to approve of the Grand Coulee (pumping plan) venture. When used as evidence in the House of Representative&#x27;s hearing by the Committee on Irrigation and Reclamation, the tide had changed and the pumping plan was approved over the gravity plan. With this approval, in 1933 President Roosevelt signed for appropriation of funds made possible by the National Industrial Recovery Act and construction on the Grand Coulee Dam began soon after.","Irrigation--United States (western)--Maps; ;; ;;; Columbia Basin Project (U.S.)", "/demo/wsu-maps/items/maps647.html" ],

By 1875, Cram owned his own publishing company in Chicago and soon rose to success by using a wax engraving process (such as perfected by the Rand McNally Company, his greatest competitor). Invented in 1834 by Richard Cary Morse and Henry A. Munson, the wax engraving process--also known as &quot;cerography&quot;--was not patented until 1848. This allowed for many engravers to perfect their own version of the method. Among them was the Rand McNally Co., which began printing maps in 1872, using a combination of Morse&#x27;s wax process and electrotyping. Invented in Russia, 1839 by a German named Jacobi, electrotyping took wax engraving one step further by coating the surface with a substance such as graphite (electrically conductive) and then submerging it all into an electrolytic bath and copper coating. When ready, the wax was then removed and the copper plate became the template for printing. While of less quality than lithography, it also cost less. By the 1890s most American publishing houses used this wax process. Cram retired in 1921, selling out to the National Map Company. In 1928, the company returned to the Cram name and it has continued in business to this day.","Washington (State)--Maps; Railroads--Washington (State)--Maps", "/demo/wsu-maps/items/maps653.html" ],

Proposed extension of existing dam shown by dashed line. Proposed dredging to 20 ft at low water shown by hachures. In order to make the city of Vancouver, Washington, more accessible by water up the Columbia, a proposal was adopted in 1892 to dam half the river south of Hayden Island, thus forcing water north of the island and creating a deeper channel past Vancouver. Work commenced that year and continued until April 1893, at which point the river rose and submerged both the dam and the island with only 60 feet remaining to be constructed. When the water receded, the island had been eroded such that 470 feet of dam was now needed. By the time a revetment was constructed to prevent further erosion, a total of 700 more feet of dam was required. Unfortunately, this was well beyond the original budget of the project. This map comes from a letter from the Secretary of War to the 54th Congress, effectively requesting more money so that the project could be finished.","Columbia River--Maps; Vancouver (Wash.)--History.", "/demo/wsu-maps/items/maps737.html" ],

Min. Sur., and from Actual Field Surveys by Henry Carr, C.E., March, 1888. This map depicts this area in its heyday. The majority of the mines here are silver mines, with a small amount of gold mining. When silver prices fell drastically in the 1890s, the area&#x27;s mines began inevitably closing. When Okanogan County was formed out of Stevens County in 1888, Ruby City (center right on the map) was made the County Seat. Some suspect this was accomplished primarily through bribery, Ruby City having the reputation of being the territory&#x27;s wildest city (one visitor termed it &quot;the Babylon of the west&quot;). The County Seat moved to Salmon City (now Conconully, lower left on the map) by election the following year. Today, nothing remains of Ruby City but a wide spot in the road and traces of old foundations. The planned town of Arlington (top center) apparently never came to fruition. It should not be confused with the city of Arlington which is now located in Snohomish County, Washington.","Washington (Terr.)--Lake Conconully--Maps; Washington (Terr.)--Salmon River--Maps; Mining Claims- Washington (Terr.)", "/demo/wsu-maps/items/maps1078.html" ],

There were a number of shipyards located along the town&#x27;s Water Street.

The post office, railroad station and general store all lay on Front Street, with the school on South and 3rd. By the time of this plat map, 1910, the Columbia and Palouse Railroad was replaced by(or perhaps incorporated into) the larger Oregon Railway and Navigation Company. Many hypotheses have been given regarding the origin of the Pampa name. Some suggest that it refers to the pampas-like grass of the region. Others guess that someone--perhaps David S.

Named after a nearby creek at Union Flat, the town of Penawawa lay twelve miles west of Almota. Its first permanent settler, Mr. Ed Johnson, arrived in 1871 and raised cattle. In 1872, the territorial road running from Walla Walla to Colville stopped at the settlement and helped its economy greatly. It was platted in 1877 by founders Emsley Flincher, C.C. Cram and Francis Marion Byrd. Cram owned a ferry business on the other side of the Snake River and Penawawa grew as a ferry station and an exchange station that kept fresh horses for the stage coach route from Spokane to Pendleton. It was widely used until the highway was built and bypassed Penawawa for Central Ferry instead. There was also a railroad in the vicinity, located near Camas Prairie Road. The Penawawa post office was in existence from 1872 to 1937. Their school, which had begun sometime before 1890, consolidated with Colfax in 1940. The cemetery was also moved to Colfax (1960) due to the likelihood of water levels rising from construction (beginning 1963)of the Little Goose Dam.","Whitman County (Wash.)--Maps; Penawawa (Wash.)--Maps; Almota (Wash.)--Maps", "/demo/wsu-maps/items/maps1162.html" ],

Land use class 3: &quot;. . . average economic productivity for the northern part of the United States . . . sufficient for a model level of living . . . &quot; Total capital per farm was between $18,000 and $25,000; family earnings were $3,500-$5,000. Land use class 4: &quot;. . . marginal economic productivity . . . sufficient to maintain only small amounts of capital per farm.&quot; Total capital per farm was about $15,000 to $17,500; family earnings per farm were between $3,000 and $3,500 in 1944. Land use class 5: &quot;Submarginal farming areas with resource combinations which are distinctly below average in economic productivity and which, while they are used extensively in relation to neighboring areas in the same type of farming region, nevertheless, are used more intensively than is justified by their basic resources. Such areas have provided . . . insufficient income for even a modest living.&quot; Farms in economic land use class 5 generated about $5,000-$7,500 in total capital in 1944; total family earnings were about $2,000 on average.

Topographic and cultural data for this map were obtained from field notes of a timber cruise and land classification conducted in 1915, 1916, and 1917. Transit and stadia were used for primary control but detail was obtained by hand level and steel tape or by foot pacing and aneroid barometer, two compass lines being run ten chains apart through each forty acre legal subdivision. Section corners were identified. The greater part of the field work was done under the immediate direction of C.R. Garvey, with F.M. Wilkes as chief topographer. J.P. Kinney, Chief Supervisor of Forests. This reservation lies west of the Willamette Meridian, Wash. Due to this map&#x27;s size and condition, it was scanned in two pieces which could not be electronically stitched back together without discontinuities.

Please drive PROMPTLY and CAREFULLY to WSU zones serving your area.     Whitman County has public shelters for all residents. In addition, many residents have home protected space which they are advised to use rather than drive to Pullman. All residents choosing to improve their home protection space, please read carefully Chapter 5 of the enclosed booklet \"IN TIME OF EMERGENCY.\"     How To Improvise Shelter For Farm Animals.  Your barn or farm utility building will provide fallout shelter for your farm animals if prepared properly.   The safest area inside your barn is at the very center of the building. Place as much of your livestock and produce in that area as possible. The roof, sidewalls, and the hayloft of your barn will provide shielding from fallout for the animals inside. You can provide additional protection by piling dirt along the outside of your barn or building.    Water from wells or any covered receptacle is safe for animal use.   Feed and fodder stored under cover should be used first. If no other food is available, animals can be turned out to pasture after a few days.   You can obtain additional information from the County Agent's office that will help you decide what crops, pasturage, and methods will be best and safest to use.
