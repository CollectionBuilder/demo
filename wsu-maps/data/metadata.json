        "description": "1 map : col. ; 40 x 55 cm. Relief shown by hachures. Shows counties, cities and railroads. Scale ca. 1:1,300,000. George F. Cram, a Union soldier who fought in Sherman&#x27;s Army during the Civil War, returned home in 1867 to Evanston, Illinois to begin a map and atlas company with his uncle, Rufus Blanchard. By 1875, Cram owned his own publishing company in Chicago and soon rose to success by using a wax engraving process (such as perfected by the Rand McNally Company, his greatest competitor). Invented in 1834 by Richard Cary Morse and Henry A. Munson, the wax engraving process--also known as &quot;cerography&quot;--was not patented until 1848. This allowed for many engravers to perfect their own version of the method. Among them was the Rand McNally Co., which began printing maps in 1872, using a combination of Morse&#x27;s wax process and electrotyping. Invented in Russia, 1839 by a German named Jacobi, electrotyping took wax engraving one step further by coating the surface with a substance such as graphite (electrically conductive) and then submerging it all into an electrolytic bath and copper coating. When ready, the wax was then removed and the copper plate became the template for printing. While of less quality than lithography, it also cost less. By the 1890s most American publishing houses used this wax process. Cram retired in 1921, selling out to the National Map Company. In 1928, the company returned to the Cram name and it has continued in business to this day.",

Scale ca. 1:3,500,000 In 1836, Congress approved the sum of $300,000 for a purely scientific exploratory expedition. The expedition, headed by Charles Wilkes, left in 1838 and returned in 1842. The scientific expedition visited at least cursorily most every non-civilized coastal area in the world, including the Pacific Northwest in 1841. Other areas visited include South America, New Zealand, Hawaii, the East Indies, Australia, and South Pacific islands too numerous to list. This expedition also provided the first proof of the existence of the continent of Antarctica. A large number of Puget Sound names which are still in use today were provided by Wilkes&#x27; expedition, Commencement Bay (where he started his charting of the sound) and Elliott Bay among them.",

Colton &amp; Co. in the Clerk&#x27;s Office of the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York.&quot; Text about Mexico on verso. Prime meridians: Greenwich and Washington. Plate no. 55. Scale [ca. 1:3,500,000] (W 125&amp;deg;--W 109&amp;deg;/N 50&amp;deg;--N 41&amp;deg;). In 1852, a group of farmers met at Cowlitz Prairie (northeast of Astoria) to discuss the formation of the Territory of Washington. Citing distance and a feeling of isolation from the Oregon territorial government based in the Willamette Valley, the Cowlitz coalition persuaded Congress to approve the new government in 1853. While Oregon was granted statehood in 1859, Washington would not formally join the Union until 1889. The new territory&#x27;s boundaries included the Columbia River in the south, the 49th parallel in the north, and the Rocky Mountains in the east.This meant that it spread through parts of what is now Wyoming, Idaho and Montana. Much of the geographical information of this area used by contemporary mapmakers came from the expeditions of John C. Fremont and the Wilkes Expedition in the early 1840s. However, another major source of land routes came from the Pacific Railway Surveys of 1853--completed by the first Governor of the Territory of Washington, Isaac I. Stevens. The proposed railroad route is visible on this map, and so perhaps publisher J.H. Colton used Steven&#x27;s findings as a source as well. Inspired by the Wilkes expedition and the travels of John C. Fremont, many settlers journeyed to Oregon Territory during the Great Migration of 1843. Just three years later, the Oregon Treaty would place the Pacific Northwest boundary between U.S. and Great Britain at the 49th Parallel. By 1853, Oregon farmers north of the Columbia River pushed Congress to create the Territory of Washington. Its original boundaries are distinguished on this map, separating it from Oregon (which was defined a territory in 1848 and would become a state in 1859) and sprawling throughout the entire region now known as Idaho, and even parts of Montana and Wyoming. New York publisher J.H. Colton&#x27;s maps at this time were lithographs derived from steel plates. The colors are applied by hand.",

The U.S had long employed civilian civil engineers for mapping and project-oriented purposes as part of a military Corps, similar to the Corps of Engineers, but it was decided that it would be less expensive to organize its own department under strict military control. The Corps provided mapping on all levels: general exploratory, military, surveying for potential railroad routes, and surveying for individual projects such as river improvements for flood control.",

Surveys completed in 1855, apparently after this map was constructed, pointed to a slightly more southerly route for the eventual Northern Pacific Railway. The route sketched here approximates several eventual routes. The Montana and east portions approximates that followed by the Burlington Northern, while that in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho follows the Northern Pacific&#x27;s eventual route in those states.",

        "description": "1 map: hand col., 24 x 22 cm. Catholic missionary and northwest explorer, Fr. Pierre John DeSmet, established a mission with the Flathead Indians of the Bitterroot Valley near present day Missoula, Montana on September 24, 1841. Having gained the respect and friendship of many neighboring tribes, in 1845 DeSmet confidently set out on a mission of peace to act as mediator between the Flatheads and their traditional foe, the Blackfoot Nation (located further east in Montana). Ever the explorer, his route took him much farther north than necessary, via the Kootenai and Vermillion Rivers, across the Continental Divide, then north to the Saskatchewan River and the Canadian Rockies. Unable to locate the Blackfeet before the onset of winter, DeSmet and his party postponed their search and wintered as guests at Fort Edmonton. Located on the North Saskatchewan River at latitude 53-30` north, near present day Edmonton in Alberta Province, Canada, Fort Edmonton (also known at that time as Fort Augustus) was the headquarters of the district lying between the Athabasca and Saskatchewan Rivers. The secondary forts within the area included Jasper House, Fort Little Slave Lake, Fort Assiniboin, and Rocky Mountain House--among others. All of these forts mentioned are visible on DeSmet&#x27;s map, perhaps a project drawn during the two winter months he sojourned there. He also visited Fathers Thibault and Bourassa at St. Anne&#x27;s Mission, located some forty miles west of Fort Edmonton. Note the lake nearby, named after Fr. Thibault. While DeSmet&#x27;s stay was a pleasant visit, he was nonetheless anxious to return to the Flatheads, and perhaps continue his search for the Blackfeet. He decided not to wait for the snow melt, and left March 12, 1846. Pushing northwest on the only trail open, DeSmet traveled approximately one hundred miles to Fort Assiniboin on the Athabasca River. Still solid ice, DeSmet traversed the river route via a sledge drawn by four malamute dogs. From Fort Assiniboin, he persisted 250 miles upstream to Jasper House, reaching the fort on March 28th. By the end of April he descended south, crossing the mountains and walking nearly 70 miles on snowshoes. Hitching a ride down the Columbia River in a canoe owned by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, DeSmet reached Ft. Colville, (a short trip west of St. Mary&#x27;s, his Flathead Mission), on May 30, 1846.",

        "description": "1 ms. map: hand col.; 26 x 22 cm. In 1840, Jesuit missionary Fr. Pierre Jean DeSmet, traveled to the Pacific Northwest upon request by the Flathead Indian nation. Returning the next year with supplies and a few fellow brethren, DeSmet founded St. Mary&#x27;s Mission on the St. Joseph River, thirty miles north of present day Missoula, Montana. DeSmet then spent ten (nonconsecutive) years in the northwest region. In those years he baptized thousands of Indians, wrote extensively of his travels, hardships and triumphs, and drew maps of the area. In a letter sent back east, he describes his attempt at map-making: &quot;...I occupied myself occasionally in drawing maps of the countries through which I passed. I availed myself of the best information I could obtain from trappers and intelligent Indians who were well acquainted with the mountain passes and the course of the rivers. Not having had instruments with me, the maps were only an approximation to the true positions.&quot; St. Mary&#x27;s (spelled by DeSmet as &quot;Marie&#x27;s&quot;) is presented in the lower left corner of the map. The closest location for supplies lay at Fort Colville, 320 miles northwest, in eastern Washington. A number of Indians lived near the fort, including those from the Okinakane (Okanogan), Skoyelpi, Chaudiere (Kettle), and Sinpoil nations. St. Paul&#x27;s, a mission established near Fort Colville, administered to these nations. Further east, DeSmet opened another mission for the Cree Indians, naming it St. Francis Regis. South of this mission lay the Spokane River and the Zingomene (Spokane) people. Further east down the Spokane River lay the Sacred Heart Mission, built for the Pointed Hearts, or Coeur d&#x27;Alene Indians. Traveling north, thirty miles from the mouth of the Clark River, DeSmet began to lay the foundation for the Pend d&#x27;Oreilles&#x27; mission, which he christened St. Ignatius in 1844. North of this location is the Kootenai River and the land of the Kootenai and Arcs-a-plats (Flatbow) Indians. Note the holy cross symbol drawn by DeSmet on the Kootenai River in the center of this map. It was at this site in August 1845 that DeSmet and the Arcs-a-plats tribe erected a cross for the Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Further north along the Kootenai River, DeSmet marked other sites with such crosses--such as the St. Coeur d&#x27;Marie and De la Nativitie--where Father DeSmet also held mass. In this area, DeSmet has also located spots where he discovered high levels of gold and other &quot;minerales&quot;. DeSmet told no one of these findings, correctly fearing the swarm of settlers that would overtake this land once word of it became known. At the top of this map, to the left of the cross dated &quot;1845&quot; is a small stream DeSmet named &quot;Morigeau&quot;. A lone Canadian living with his native family in the wilderness, DeSmet came across Mr. Morigeau while journeying to the Canadian Rockies in search of the Blackfeet nation. All of these occurrences are described in his many letters to friends and family, both in Europe and the eastern United States.",

Note also Utah Territory (green). Worried by the streaming mass of miners coming into the area in 1849, the Mormons invited Europeans interested in their faith (particularly from England) to come and populate Utah. This map, published by Thomas Cowperthwait &amp; Co., may be from an atlas set contracted to him by S. Augustus Mitchell. Cowperthwait began publishing Mitchell&#x27;s New Universal Atlas in 1850, printing the atlas until 1856. (At that time it was taken over by another well-known mapmaker, Charles DeSilver.) Cowperthwait continued to use Mitchell maps in various forms well into the 1880s.",

When Washington Territory was created out of the Oregon Territory in 1853, newly appointed Governor Isaac Stevens immediately pushed for the surveying of a route over which a transcontinental railway could be run. To this end, he asked for and got several teams of government surveyors who proceeded to begin charting passes and routes across the Washington Territory. As the best routes were eventually chosen, the survey of the specific route began in 1858. The Mullan road (named for John Mullan, the primary surveyor of the route and the man subsequently placed in charge of the road&#x27;s construction), a permanent wagon road from the Mississippi River to the Puget Sound, was constructed in 1859-1860. In 1861 and 1862, an improved road was constructed and slightly rerouted. When the Northern Pacific Railroad was built approximately a quarter century later, it followed Mullan&#x27;s route very closely.",

When Washington Territory was created out of the Oregon Territory in 1853, newly appointed Governor Isaac Stevens immediately pushed for the surveying of a route over which a transcontinental railway could be run. To this end, he asked for and got several teams of government surveyors who proceeded to begin charting passes and routes across the Washington Territory. As the best routes were eventually chosen, the survey of the specific route began in 1858. The Mullan road (named for John Mullan, the primary surveyor of the route and the man subsequently placed in charge of the road&#x27;s construction), a permanent wagon road from the Mississippi River to the Puget Sound, was constructed in 1859-1860. In 1861 and 1862, an improved road was constructed and slightly rerouted. When the Northern Pacific Railroad was built approximately a quarter century later, it followed Mullan&#x27;s route very closely.",

To this end, he asked for and got several teams of government surveyors who proceeded to begin charting passes and routes across the Washington Territory. As the best routes were eventually chosen, the survey of the specific route began in 1858. The Mullan road (named for John Mullan, the primary surveyor of the route and the man subsequently placed in charge of the road&#x27;s construction), a permanent wagon road from the Mississippi River to the Puget Sound, was constructed in 1859-1860. In 1861 and 1862, an improved road was constructed and slightly rerouted. When the Northern Pacific Railroad was built approximately a quarter century later, it followed Mullan&#x27;s route very closely.",

Gray, the author of this map, is the son of Ormando Willis Gray, a mapmaker in Philadelphia. Very little is known of their partnership. However, O.W. Gray, a civil engineer and topographical surveyor by training, did earlier work with the better known author of state atlases--Mr. Henry F. Walling. Gray and Walling worked together on three topographical state atlas projects: Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, both in 1871 and Ohio in 1872. In 1873, Gray authored the &quot;Gray&#x27;s Atlas of the United States with general maps of the World&quot;. It was revised annually until 1879. He also joined his son in 1875 to produce &quot;The Natural Atlas, containing elaborate topographical maps of the United States and the Dominion of Canada.&quot; The Natural Atlas enjoyed reprinting up until 1889. Perhaps this Washington and Oregon map stemmed as a precursor to the atlas set. Most of his maps, whether with Walling or his son or on his own, were published by Stedman, Brown &amp; Lyon.",

Under this agreement, the land--occupied jointly between the two countries since 1818--was split among them. The U.S. won the territory stretching from the Rocky Mountains in the east to the Pacific Ocean on the west, and as far north as the 49th parallel. In this map, published by S. Augustus Mitchell one year after the decision, the disputed land is hand colored in a pink wash. The 49th parallel boundary line is washed in a blue hue, as well is Vancouver Island. After 1846, Britain still held Vancouver Island, the Queen Charlotte Islands, and the mainland from 49th north to the 54&amp;deg;40 mark. Vancouver Island and British Columbia would later join in territorial government, but chose confederation with the Dominion of Canada over annexation to the United States in 1871.",

Oregon was the first to form an organized government, and was admitted into the union as the 33rd state under a law signed by President Buchanan, February 14, 1859. Montana, its population swelling with the gold rush fever, became the 41st state on November 8, 1889. Washington followed soon after, becoming the 42nd state just three days later. Idaho joined the union the following year, July 3 1890, as the 43rd state. S. Augustus Mitchell Jr.&#x27;s map does contain the California Emigrant Road, however the focus of this map is clearly the colored demarcations of the northwest territories. While the Mitchell company had been mechanically chromolithographing the decorative borders since the 1860s, this map&#x27;s border is black and white. All of the color on the map itself was produced by hand. The borders of the states/territories that are the focus of this map are finalized here. The San Juan Islands are in Washington, and the Wyoming/Idaho border is correctly portrayed. Although Nevada and Wyoming are apparently shown to be part of Utah, both were in fact in existence, Nevada as a state, and Wyoming as a Territory.",

        "description": "1 map: col., 28 x 34 cm. One of the first successful American publishing companies to venture beyond the east coast, Rand McNally and Co. began in Chicago, 1856, under William H. Rand. Rand soon after employed printer Andrew McNally, and by 1868 the two men had become partners. Early on, the duo published mostly timetables and tickets for the Railroad companies. Rand McNally took on map publishing in 1871, and has continued in this business ever since. This map of Washington territory, 1881, highlights travel routes of the Northern Pacific Railroad, both proposed and in service. It also shows the &quot;gold regions&quot; to be mined and historic wagon routes, such as the wagon road to Walla Walla and Oregon&#x27;s Emigrant Road. The map was printed from a method of wax engraving and electrotyping introduced to the company by engraver Charles H. Waite. Mr. Waite also showed the company how to reproduce color mechanically, rather than by hand. Both of these skills Waite gained while working for other publishers, but the methods achieved prominence at Rand McNally. Note also the map&#x27;s border. The now familiar index system was new at the time--invented in the 1870s by Rand McNally&#x27;s map department director, Mr. Robert A. Bower. The system has become a standard locator on maps today.",

It can be definately identified as being after 1865 and before 1875. The area was first settled in the early 1860s, for its rich farmland and easily accessible lumber. The towns first trading post, post office, and saloon were all built on Florence Island on George Kyle&#x27;s land in about 1865. In 1878 the post office moved to the north shore of the river, and Centreville changed its name to Stanwood.",

        "description": "1 map: col., 37 x 28 cm. One of the leading map publishing companies of the 20th century, Rand McNally and Co. began in Chicago, 1865. Under the partnership of William H. Rand and Andrew McNally (started in 1868), the company quickly grew from railroad timetable and ticket printer to publisher of fine railroad maps and atlases. Two of their most famous publications are the &quot;Pocket Maps&quot;--first released in 1872 and the &quot;Business Atlas&quot;, released under one name or another from 1876 to 1991. In this map of Washington Territory, 1882, the county lines are delineated in pink. The map was most likely mechanically colored, a technique that was brought to the company by one of its earliest employees--engraver Charles H. Waite. He also brought with him the knowledge and use of wax engraving. Rand McNally was one of the first to use the method. However, contemporary publishers such as the Mitchell Company and G.W. Colton continued to use lithography--preferring its quality. Yet, wax engraving was cheaper and could be easily corrected. It also could imprint typesetting--which greatly improved the look of busy / cluttered railroad maps, and so was the preferred choice of the map department at Rand McNally.",

Cram, a Union soldier who fought in Sherman&#x27;s Army during the Civil War, returned home in 1867 to Evanston, Illinois to begin a map and atlas company with his uncle, Rufus Blanchard. By 1875, Cram owned his own publishing company in Chicago and soon rose to success by using a wax engraving process (similar to that perfected by the Rand McNally Company, his greatest competitor). Invented in 1834 by Richard Cary Morse and Henry A. Munson, the wax engraving process--also known as &quot;cerography&quot;--was not patented until 1848. This allowed for many engravers to perfect their own version of the method. Among them was the Rand McNally Co., which began printing maps in 1872, using a combination of Morse&#x27;s wax process and electrotyping. Invented in Russia, 1839 by a German named Jacobi, electrotyping took wax engraving one step further by coating the surface with a substance such as graphite (electrically conductive) and then submerging it all into an electrolytic bath and copper coating. When ready, the wax was then removed and the copper plate became the template for printing. While of less quality than lithography, it also cost less. By the 1890s most American publishing houses used this wax process. Cram retired in 1921, selling out to the National Map Company. In 1928, the company returned to the Cram name and it has continued in business to this day.",

Augustus Jr. His son continued with his father&#x27;s high standards, and while most American publishers were switching to the cheaper process of wax engraving, Mitchell retained the use of hand engravings transferred onto lithographic stone. He also kept the tradition of hand colored washes for the maps. In this map, the border of Washington territory is hand washed in red, Oregon state in blue, and the border of Idaho in green. Note that Idaho&#x27;s border now separates Washington territory into the region we recognize as its present, state shape. Idaho was granted its own territorial status in 1863, three years prior to the release of this map. This map apparently anticipates the formation of the Wyoming Territory, which was discussed under several possible names as early as 1865, but not finalized until 1868 (at which time the Idaho/Wyoming border was changed at the last minute).",

Washington became a territory in 1853, arguing that distances to Willamette Valley kept them from obtaining a voice in the Oregon territorial government.

William Parkhurst Winans worked from 1870 to 1872 as Indian Sub-Agent for the tribes surrounding Fort Colville in Stevens County, Washington Territory. This hand drawn map delineates the area and number of the tribes for which he was hired to serve. Note the numbers written next to the tribe names. These numbers represent the population total for each of the tribes: Methow (311), Okanogan (340), San Poels (538), Spokans (725), Colvills (631), Callispels (420), Lakes (230) and Coeur d&#x27; Alenes (154). At the time this map was drawn, the total population of whites living in the Colville Valley area came to approximately less than 400, including women and children. However, Winans and other Colville locals pressed President Grant to change the reservation boundary lines installed in 1871, citing the disturbance that would surely ensue should the whites be forced from their already improved claims. Trusting the settler&#x27;s testimonials, Grant unwittingly removed the Indians to desolate highlands on the opposite side of their Columbia River homelands and away from their ancestral fishery at Kettle Falls. The Department of Indian Affairs soon became aware of Winans&#x27; chicanery, and while the President did not reinstate the original reservation lands, Winans was replaced by Indian Agent John A. Simms in 1872.",

One of the first to employ the printing method of lithography, Mitchell was also one of the early users of a chromolithographed, decorative border. When Mitchell retired from the business in 1860, his son, S. Augustus, Jr. took his place. The company continued to prosper under his direction, and at its height employed over 250 workers and held 400,000 annual publications. This map further refines previous maps: of immediate note is the much more defined border between Idaho and Montana. This map seems to anticipate the formation of the Wyoming Territory. Though discussed as early as 1865, it didn&#x27;t come to pass until 1868, at which time the Idaho/Wyoming border was also rewritten at the last moment.",

Pine City scale 400&#x27;=1&quot;. A past director of the Northern Pacific Railroad, Mr. August Belmont, was given recognition when the town of Belmont, Washington was named after him in 1885. However, as with other Whitman County towns, other stories as to the name&#x27;s origin have been suggested. Among these is the theory that Belmont means &quot;beautiful mountain&quot; and refers to the scenic view from there of Steptoe Butte. Another report said that there was a Belmont family that pioneered in the area. However it received its name, Belmont remained the NPRR rail terminus for only two years, when that distinction was pushed on to Lewiston, Idaho. Today it lies along the Burlington Northern line, and claims a few homes and a grain elevator. Hay, Washington&#x27;s naming stories run along similar lines: apparently the siding (flag stop for the Oregon Railway &amp; Navigation Railroad) was stocked with an abundance of much needed Hay during the blizzard of 1893. It became known as &quot;Hay Station&quot; and later, just Hay. The town itself did not expand greatly until the 1920s and 1930s, when many of its buildings were constructed. Pine City&#x27;s beginnings was as a stage, not railroad station, of the Texas Ferry Road. The road ran from Walla Walla to Colville, and was originally an Indian road called &quot;Texas Trail.&quot; Mr. Z.F. Dodson, an 1878 settler, platted the town in 1881. In just that first year, the town held a number of businesses, including a doctor&#x27;s office, the Anderson-Edwards Four Mill, a number of general stores, a hotel, livery, blacksmith shop and a saloon. The Chicago Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad came in 1905, and the mill was moved from its original site to make room for it.",

In 1886, the Oregon and Washington Railway &amp; Navigation Co. built track running from Portland into eastern Washington. The track ended at Farmington, named after Farmington, Minnesota, the hometown of plat filer George Washington Campbell Traux. Arriving there with a few other pioneers in the early 1870s, Traux took advantage of the availability of cheap land, and had a survey done of eighty acres for town plats. The town incorporated in 1888. While stock raising was the first economy in the area, wheat growers soon took over, and sent their goods to nearby Almota to be shipped off to market. Another local trade was found in forming shakes for roofs. These hand crafted items were made from local cedar. In the early days (1870s)search parties were often formed to look for children who had gotten lost in the bunchgrass on their way to school! However, by the 1890s the area was well on its way to development and a number of businesses could be found there, including a general store, blacksmith, livery stable, meat market, hotel, hardware, drugstore, creamery, brewery, flourmill, brick factory and even a planing mill. By the 1890s the population reached over 1,000. Yet this pace would not be maintained into the next decade. The population took a steady decline following the transfer of the railroad line to Tekoa, Washington in the early 1900s. Of historical note: a number of Chinese settlers also lived in Farmington. Two full blocks on Washington Street was considered to be a Chinatown district. Also during this time period, two fires changed look of the town&#x27;s business sector. The first fire came in 1897. The second, in 1906, burned down the town hall where city records were kept.",

Diamond scale 400&#x27;=1&quot;. The town of Colton, eleven miles south of Pullman, began as a settlement in 1879. Mr. Gregor Koshir filed the town plat in 1881 and it was incorporated the year following. There are a number of variances regarding the naming of the town. Some records say that it was named for Dr. J.A. Cole, the town&#x27;s benefactor who helped obtain the post office and school in 1879 and 1889, respectively. Other reports say it was named through the joining of the names of two settlers: Cole and Worthington. Still another tale suggests that it was named by Dr. Cole, Ray Woodworth, and L.J. Wolford. These three supposedly took the &quot;Col&quot; of Cole and &quot;ton&quot; from Clinton--the son of L.J. Wolford. Early Colton had a large Catholic contingency. In 1892 the Benedictine Sisters arrived, establishing St. Andrews Convent and a school. They remained to teach until 1937, when the entire convent returned to their home base in Cottonwood, Idaho. In 1937, however, the Notre Dame Sisters arrived to continue the school. Staley, just five miles south of Pullman, was soon enveloped by the college town. Mr. and Mrs. Daniel Staley (some records report that it was David Staley), purposely platted the town in the hopes that its proximity to the Northern Pacific Railroad line would ensure its success. Nine miles west of Colfax on Rebel Flat, Mr. Q. Diamond platted a town and named it after himself circa 1886. The Columbia and Palouse Railroad (later sold to Union Pacific) ran through Rebel Flat. The town school, begun in the 1890s, consolidated with Colfax by 1938 and the post office closed in 1956.",

Revere, Pandora, and Palisades scale 800&#x27;=1&quot;. Of the five platted towns, only Endicott and Almota grew to any significance. In 1909 the Milwaukee Road, a part of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad, held an auction in Spokane for land at five locations along their tracks. Among them was Pandora. It lay eight miles north of Oakesdale, in the Pine Creek Valley. The C.M.S.P RR also named the town of Revere--located 30 miles northwest of Colfax--after Paul Revere. Some people already lived in the area prior to the coming of the C.M.P.S., and even a school was established in 1910. Much less information is available, however, for the C.M.P.S. flag stop known as Palisade. It lay on the northeast side of Rock Lake and so at times was even called &quot;Rock Lake Station&quot; instead. Endicott was founded in 1882 by the Oregon Land and Improvement Co., and was named for William Endicott, Jr., a shareholder in the company. Prior to this name settlers from the confederacy called the area &quot;Rebel Flat&quot;. A number of German-Russians settled there during the years 1882-1907, buying land communally and splitting it among them. Almota, on the north side of the Snake River almost 40 miles above Clarkston, was early on used by Nez Perce Indians as a fishing site. &quot;Allamotin&quot;, &quot;Almotine&quot;, and even &quot;Alto Motin&quot; have been given as Nez Perce names for the area, meaning &quot;torchlight&quot; or &quot;moonlight fishing&quot;. Almota, soon became the trading/shipping center for all of Inland Empire, but lost some of its business when rail lines arrived in Colfax in 1883. The Oregon, Washington and Idaho Railroad and the Snake River Valley Railroad would not arrive in Almota until 1907. Today it is located near Lake Bryan, the reservoir formed from the construction of the Little Goose Dam.",

Chambers has been described as an &quot;odd-shaped town&quot;, consisting of one to five block streets. The shortest street, Granite, ran along beside the Northern Pacific Railroad. The name Granite was at times given to the school district as well. (The school, begun on Drain Street in 1893, consolidated with Pullman in 1938). Chambers did not grow much and the post office--started in 1901--closed down just five years later. The small town of Hooper was named after early settler, Albert J. Hooper. However, he never owned land in the actual town, set up by the Oregon Railway and Navigation Co. He was honored by them because he had a good ranch nearby. The real founders of Hooper, the McGregor Brothers, came in 1888. They worked hard and eventually opened a store there in 1900 that remained in business for a long time after. Hooper lies on the east bank of the Palouse River. LaCrosse began as a post office station in 1892 and was at that time known as Dunlor. There are two stories regarding the naming of the town. The Oregon Railway &amp; Navigation Co. built a line from Riparia to LaCrosse in 1888. One of its surveyors hailed from LaCrosse, Wisconsin and so named the town. Another story says that the town is named after its numerous cross streets. Whichever story is correct, in 1896, the Post Office name was changed to match the town. The town did not incorporate until 1917, but chose 1899 settler, Harding Shobe, as its first mayor. Shobe land is shown on the map.",

Records show that as early as 1875 the area had a post office. By 1890 it had a school district known by the area&#x27;s main benchland--Tennessee Flat. However, with the arrival of the track running from Spokane to Colfax, the name was changed and in 1907 the Railroad Land and Improvement Co. platted the area for a proper townsite. The town was named in recognition of Lieutenant Colonel Edward J. Steptoe, who had battled with local Native Americans at a butte near Rosalia in the 1850s. The town is located about 10 miles from Colfax.",

The railway officials named the town for an early settler--Mr. Edward T. St. John. St. John donated much of the original town land, on the provision that the square block in the center of town would always be a park. In 1888-89, the Oregon Railway Extension Co. built a line running into St. John. This line later became a part of the Washington Division of the Pleasant Valley Branch, which in time was taken over by the Union Pacific. Not much is known of the early development of Winona, except that the Washington and Idaho Railroad, a subsidiary of the Oregon Railway and Navigation Co. began the Pleasant Valley line to travel from Winona to Seltice by way of Thornton. Winona was named after one of the surveyors&#x27; home town--Winona, Minnesota. As stated above, Union Pacific bought out the O.R.&amp; N.Co.&#x27;s line, and by 1925 wanted to end the Pleasant Valley road. However, UPRR did not receive government approval of the termination until the early 1930s.",

Located 12 miles northeast of Colfax, the Palouse River runs directly through the town. Manuscripts, Archives and Special Collections at WSU has the manuscript history of the town and one of it&#x27;s earliest settlers, Mr. John Weber Leid. Sites shown on this map are discussed in Leid&#x27;s manuscript, including the Oregon, Washington Railway and Navigation Depot (O.W.R.&amp; N.) built in 1888, the post office, run by Mr. Joe McCoy, and the two room school house. The school, built in 1890, soon had an addition of two more rooms, but with the economic success that came with the railroad, the town grew so fast that a store was rented downtown for classrooms. Elberton&#x27;s main economy was the saw mill, but there was also a flour mill, which is shown on this map. Another interesting business in town was the Oregon Evaporated Co. owned by W. Allen Newberry. Begun in 1902, the company owned the distinction of being the largest prune dehydrator in the world. Thornton, begun around the same time, was a stop on the &quot;Pleasant Valley Line&quot; of the Washington &amp; Idaho Railroad, a subsidiary of the Oregon Railway &amp; Navigation Co.

Located twenty miles north of Colfax, the town of Malden, Washington was named by the then Vice President of the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul Railway--Mr. H. R. Williams. When his company extended their rail to the Puget Sound, they chose the Malden area as a &quot;division point&quot;. No town site had yet existed there, but it would soon become a stopping point for the &quot;Milwaukee Road&quot;&#x27;s change crew, their repair and stock shops, and administrative offices. Soon following the construction of the C.M. &amp; P.S. Railway&#x27;s station, freight depot, roundhouse, and switchyard in 1909, Malden town boasted of eighty buildings and a population of nearly 450. In 1910, the year of this plat map, the census showed 798 people and growing. However, Malden could never diversify its economy and when--due to technological advancements and a reduction in rail use in America--the C.M. &amp; P.S. line closed their Puget Sound line in 1980, the town had already suffered a substantial decrease in population (around 200), and by then railroad families had moved on for work.

A number of buildings were constructed at this time, including the large and important addition of a hospital (see to the left of the title.) Troy Hall, which was built in 1926 and housed the dairy industry department, was the last substantial building before this surge. A budget crisis in the 1930s resulted in little construction being undertaken. In fact, in 1933-34, both Ferry Hall (men&#x27;s) and Steven&#x27;s Hall (women&#x27;s) dormitories were closed down. Of the students that continued in their studies, many of the men lived in makeshift shacks, dotted throughout campus and in town, or wherever unoccupied land was available.",

The school grew within the decade however, and new departments were formed. The school changed its name in 1905 to Washington State College in part to reflect these additions. While times were lean during World War I and directly after, by 1928 the nation experienced a surge in its economy. Washington State College was no different. A number of buildings were completed during this time, including White Hall and Troy Hall, the Hospital and the field house.

        "description": "1 map; 20 x 26 cm. Map of the campus of Washington State College in Pullman, Washington. This map shows the footprints of main buildings on campus in 1938. While it designates the major roads running through the campus, it does not name them. It also has a faint trace in the lower right-hand corner of a title, written in pencil and then erased. The golf clubhouse title and building are also painted over in white. These corrections suggest that the drawing was an early map template. The same general format was used in the printed map of around 1942. The 1942 map has some additions and reductions to the buildings, but more importantly, it names the area&#x27;s streets and looks like a finished, polished product. By the time of this map, the field house and Bohler gym were reaching their twelfth year, as was the hospital. Following World War II, the horse barn, incubator and brooder house area were razed--to be replaced by new dormitories and the right of way of the Stadium Loop Highway (Stadium Way). The old power house on this map became the fire station not long after the drafting of this map.",

Five national fraternities and four sororities soon made visible additions to campus life. By 1936, the number of students living in Greek houses nearly matched that of dormitory residents. This 1939 map of campus and downtown Pullman documents the rapid expansion of the system at WSC, which totaled thirty-four Greek houses on campus at that time and an enrollment of 4,035 students. Leading up to that point, however, the 1930s Great Depression hindered campus living somewhat, and left many students out of dorms completely. A number of young men lived out the school year in self-built shacks on empty properties around the campus. While the economy improved by 1939, new buildings or additions would not be constructed until a few years after World War II. Post-war students and faculty made do with shipped-in structures and furniture surplus no longer needed by the Army.",

Map prepared by Highway Engineering Department of the State Agriculture College (WSU). Under the Morrill Act of 1862, all states were granted land on which to develop a college focused on the advancement of agriculture. The 1877 Hatch Act added to this donation, by funding scientific research at these institutions for its dissemination to the general public. The goal for both was to raise the level of farming practices everywhere. Pullman, a town dominated by a wheat-growing economy, fought for and won the right to the land grant in 1892. Under the administration of its second president, E.A. Bryan (1893-1916), the first wave of extensive building took place on campus. The Mechanic Arts Building, a womens dormitory later called Stevens Hall, and the Administration Building on College Hill were constructed in 1895. The brick and granite Administration Building was home to labs, library, classrooms and an assembly hall. Trees originating from nearby Moscow Mountain were transplanted on campus during the first Arbor Day celebration in 1896, and a men&#x27;s dormitory, Ferry Hall, came in 1897. Science Hall (1900), located in what is now half of the Morrow Building, boasted labs and lecture rooms and even museums. By 1908 the Domestic Economy department grew in both stature and size to where it earned its own building, Van Doren Hall. This new building was joined that year by Bryan Hall, first called the Library and Assembly Hall, College Hall for recitation classes, and a number of farm buildings, a hydraulic lab, and a veterinary hospital wing. All of these buildings and more can be seen on this map. By June, 1917 the school held five colleges: Agriculture, Mechanical Arts and Engineering, Sciences and Arts, Veterinary Science, and Home Economics. It also had four schools: Mines, Education, Pharmacy and Music/Applied Design.",

In 1892, Washington&#x27;s land-grant college (Washington Agriculture College as it was then called) had its beginnings on a barren, dusty hilltop overlooking the young town of Pullman. While a number of years and many methods were spent attempting to beautify the school, by it&#x27;s twentieth anniversary comments were still heard around campus regarding the school&#x27;s ungainliness. Much of the problem stemmed from the inability of transplanted trees and shrubs to thrive in their new environment--despite the best attempts of successive Horticulture Department heads. Even the students pitched in to help, annually planting trees on Arbor Day (many of which came from Moscow Mountain) and taking one day of the year for a campus clean-up session. However, not until around 1920 were professional landscape designers brought in for consultation on the problem. Improvements thereafter came swiftly and successfully, and a few respected firms, such as the authors of this 1937 landscape study--Morell &amp; Nichols, Inc. of Minneapolis, Minnesota--gained regular employment. In time, this and other firms developed the campus into something &quot;creditable&quot; and collegial looking.",

        "description": "1 map; 23 x 31 cm. The campus of the state&#x27;s land grant school--Washington State College in Pullman, Washington. By 1950, WSC had developed into an institution claiming over five thousand students. Four major changes took place in the five years following the war. An increase in enrollment due to the G.I. Bill, caused an urgent need for temporary housing. The Army responded by donating a number of surplus living quarters and furniture left over from wartime cantonments. While other units were placed on campus elsewhere, the main area of growth sprung up along the boundary of the WSC golf course and were appropriately named North, East and South Fairway. Peacetime also signaled the arrival of a new president. E.O. Holland, following a stint of ill health, stepped down from the position he had held for three decades and took an advisory position in the library. He was replaced by Wilson M. Compton, who sought increased faculty satisfaction and student physical and mental well-being. The latter goal resulted in more campus activities, counseling services, and the construction of a student union building in 1951. Up until this time, students used the old women&#x27;s gymnasium, but that building was razed to make room for another major addition soon to arrive on campus--a state-of-the-art library. Plans for an improved library facility had been in the works since 1937. By the time funds became available after the war, it was apparent to all that an architectural &quot;monument&quot; as originally slated under the Holland administration would no longer suffice. With the appointment of Dr. G Donald Smith as library director, the designs were re-drafted to reflect modern needs. This meant not only space for microfilm and movies, but also the centralization of the library&#x27;s entire collection into one building. Before, the collections were held in a variety of short-term repositories beyond that of Bryan Hall because of lack of storage space. Among these included the Home Economics Building, the Women&#x27;s Gym and even the Rifle Range. On this map a building marked &quot;library storage&quot; attests to this practice. The improved library increased the viability of a competitive graduate program and, along with President Compton&#x27;s efforts to establish WSC as a center for technological and industrial advancement, easily placed the college in a position to obtain university status in 1959.",

During World War II, WSC learned that while it was located in rural Washington State, it still could hold an important place in the success of the war effort. In 1939 it began a number of training courses and housed a number of Army recruits. Victory gardens and crops were planted all over the conducive Palouse hills, and both students and faculty alike left campus and put their careers on hold to help the war effort. Many students went off to fight, while many faculty went to work for the government--their scientific expertise providing a great service toward the nation&#x27;s defense. With the return of these students, plus many more making use of the G.I. Bill, the school experienced a great housing shortage and a number of laboratories and classrooms were in an irreparable state. In 1942, the men&#x27;s dorms, Stimson and Ferry Hall, had been turned over strictly for military use. Civilian students were housed only in Waller Hall or privately run Pine Manor. The only campus dormitory that ran as a cooperative completely operated by students, Pine Manor was built in 1938 and boarded 85 men. It closed its doors sometime in the 1960s but greatly helped the postwar housing shortage.",

        "description": "1 map; 18 x 32 cm. A map of the campus of Washington State&#x27;s land-grant school--Washington State College. Set up initially with a focus on agriculture, by 1913 it also included courses in business, foreign languages, home economics, pharmaceuticals and veterinary medicine. A number of buildings no longer standing on the present campus are represented on this map. For example, the hospital situated to the right of College Hall was built in 1903. Construction for the new John A. Finch Memorial hospital began in 1928 and was located south of this map&#x27;s boundaries. A women&#x27;s dormitory shortage in 1930 brought the old hospital a new use, however, when thirty female students claimed a home out of its quarters and changed the hospital&#x27;s name to &quot;Maple Cottage&quot;. A number of new buildings were constructed around the time of this map as well. In 1913 the President&#x27;s Mansion was built, and from 1912 to 1915 workers began both the Mechanical Arts Building and Wilson Hall, then known as the Agricultural Building. Note also the northeast portion of this map. Silver Lake is no longer a part of the campus, but in 1899 the school purchased six acres lying north of the athletic fields and a one and a half acre lake--known affectionately by students as Lake de Puddle--was formed. To make room for gyms and the Bailey baseball field, Silver Lake was drained in 1927. However, one recreation area has withstood the many developments of the school and is present today--Rogers Field. In 1894, just two years following the school&#x27;s opening, students already felt the necessity of a playfield. Originally, the area was known as &quot;Soldier&#x27;s Field&quot;, but its name was changed in 1902 to honor Washington State&#x27;s Governor John R. Rogers.",

France was still interested in the area, and it was Duflot de Mofras&#x27; job to report the possibility of setting up a post in the region. During his journeys he traveled through California (Monterrey, San Diego, the Ross Settlement and others) as well as Fort Vancouver and the Columbia River. This steel-engraved, hand-colored map, drawn for his two volume report, charts the course of the Columbia River. Duflot de Mofras was influential in the idea that the Columbia River was not suitable for an ocean port. In fact, he described the sand bar near Cape Disappointment as a &quot;hideous spectacle...with foam cloaking the horizon far out at sea as if to form an insurmountable barrier to ships entering or leaving the river.&quot;",

It also shows a large portion of northern Idaho territory, established in 1863. Major landforms such as the Blue and Cascade Mountain ranges and the Columbia River are shown. The first white settlement in this area was Fort Colville (1826-1871), located north of Kettle Falls on the Columbia River. (Kettle Falls was the ancestral fishing site for many Native American tribes, but now lies under Lake Roosevelt, the reservoir of Grand Coulee Dam.) Fort Colville began as a fur trading post until 1846, when it then took on the business of supplying pioneers arriving after the 49th parallel boundary settlement between Great Britain and the United States. One year after its closing, the Colville Indian Reservation was established under a Executive Order signed by President U.S. Grant.This map is most likely drawn by (or for) one of the first Indian Agents of the reservation--Mr. William Parkhurst Winans. Removed from his office in 1873 and replaced by John A. Simms, Winans was known to have worked with a number of white settlers living in the Colville Valley to successfully petition the removal of the reservation from choice land on one side of the Columbia to barren highlands on the other side.",

Their efforts stemmed from a desire to see the entire state in top production and farming communities everywhere in need of railroad shipping services. This map shows the Inland Empire and more importantly, the Columbia Basin Irrigation Project at one of its most crucial times of development. The Inland Empire consisted of eastern Washington, northern Idaho, and northeast Oregon from between the Cascade Mountains to the Rocky Mountains. Within it lay &quot;Big Bend&quot; country--the region farmers flocked to when Palouse land was no longer available. (On this map it is shaded a dark green) For this reason, Big Bend was also known as the &quot;Empire within an Empire&quot;. It held some 2,800,000 acres, of which half were irrigable, lying ninety miles from north to south and sixty miles east to west. The project was much too large for one railroad company or town, or other private investor to take handle. By 1919, a number of government agencies (both state and federal) reviewed irrigation plans for the area. Among the top three were the &quot;Gravity Plan&quot;, pushed by the city of Spokane and the Washington Water Power Company, the &quot;Pumping Plan&quot; proposed by Billy Clapp of Ephrata and supported by the surveys of Mr. James O&#x27;Sullivan, and the &quot;Wenatchee Lake Plan&quot;, originating with Wenatchee Valley booster, Mr. Rufus Woods and taken on by the Quincy Valley Water Users Association. The Wenatchee Lake Plan proposed a gravity canal built from Wenatchee Lake in the mountains down to the floor of the Quincy Valley and would only water 400,000 acres. The Pumping Plan involved the erection of a dam at Grand Coulee, giving water to an estimated 1,400,000 acres in the Big Bend country to its south. This map supported the Gravity Plan, which would build a low masonry dam on Pend Oreille River at Albeni Falls, Idaho and hold the waters at Pend Oreille Lake and Priest Lake, Idaho. The reservoir lay approximately forty miles from Spokane. The water would then be sent (by gravity) through a series of canals and tunnels, siphons and aqueducts--even lakes--until it reached the Big Bend country 130 miles below. This plan predicted water for the most amount of acres (1, 750,000) and was touted as economically feasible. Throughout the 1920s, a number of survey reports weighing the feasibility of both plans were given, and approved the gravity plan over the pumping plan. However, the Corps of Engineers&#x27; &quot;308 Report&quot; compiled by Major John S. Butler, was the first to approve of the Grand Coulee (pumping plan) venture. When used as evidence in the House of Representative&#x27;s hearing by the Committee on Irrigation and Reclamation, the tide had changed and the pumping plan was approved over the gravity plan. With this approval, in 1933 President Roosevelt signed for appropriation of funds made possible by the National Industrial Recovery Act and construction on the Grand Coulee Dam began soon after.",

Washington Agriculture College began in 1892, on the hills overlooking the fifteen year old, wheat-growing town of Pullman, Washington. A land-grant college funded by the Morrill Land Act of 1862, the school&#x27;s purpose was to educate Washington State farmers in the latest crop and animal husbandry practices and technological advances. This map of Washington State College (the school changed its name in 1905) shows what is today the center of campus. In 1892, the campus consisted of the two and a half story College Hall (shown here) which held the President&#x27;s office, classrooms and labs, a library and an assembly hall, a one story classroom building called &quot;the crib&quot;, a number of farm buildings, a workshop, and a five story, co-ed dorm. Within the next few years (1894-96) the school added the Mechanic Arts Hall, the Administration building, and a women&#x27;s dorm (later called Stevens Hall). Science Hall and Ferry Hall (a men&#x27;s dorm that had burned down in 1897) were constructed in 1899, with Morrill Hall coming sometime soon after. One of the programs to gain its own department building was the Domestic Economy program. Begun in 1903, the field gained such prominence that Van Doren Hall was built to hold its classrooms and dining facilities in 1908. Other early draws to the school were courses taught towards Veterinary Medicine and Pharmacist training. The veterinary hospital and hydraulics lab shown on this map were constructed in 1907. The building marked &quot;Auditorium and Library&quot; is Bryan Hall, designed by architect J.K. Dow and completed in 1909. It was named after the second president of the college--Enoch A. Bryan.",

        "description": "1 map; 29 x 44 cm. Includes numbered Veteran&#x27;s Housing. In 1946, Washington State College began a policy of entrance requirements for students. A housing shortage in the years directly following the Second World War forced the college to recognize that it could no longer accept everyone. Resident veterans received first priority, followed by Washington residents with an acceptable grade point average. Faculty and staff also felt the housing shortage. A number of new homes were built on Military Hill and near the Finch Memorial Hospital to house employees. Students lived in temporary dorms previously used as US Army cantonments. They were shipped to the school and situated near the golf course. Known as North, South and East Fairway, a number of veterans lived in these buildings. The student union building in the center of campus on this map is not the same building used today. It was known as the TUB--or temporary union building--and was originally the women&#x27;s gymnasium. Students began to use the area as a community center sometime in the early 1940s. However, President Compton felt the need for a new, modern building to help unite the campus. The TUB was torn down and replaced with the Compton Union Building in 1951. The building&#x27;s dedication came shortly after his forced resignation--brought about by politics found within the Board of Regents at the time. Compton was replaced in 1952 by C. Clement French, the Vice President of Texas Agriculture and Mechanical College, also a land-grant school.",

The Ahtanum Irrigation District is marked in red. Ahtanum Creek borders the north boundary of the Yakima [Yakama] Indian Reservation. Its waters supply irrigation for some 10,000 acres that make up the Ahtanum Irrigation District in Yakima County. The creek flows into the Yakima River, and at one time supplied salmon to a number of Native American fishing sites along its route. A number of settlers arrived in the region during the 1860s and 1870s. By 1871, the Ahtanum Creek was diverted through an irrigation ditch onto newly claimed farmlands and sped the growth of the town of North Yakima ( the name changed to Yakima in 1918) which incorporated in 1886. The Northern Pacific Railroad and Yakima Irrigation Company won right of way across the Yakima Indian Reservation (begun 1855) to construct an irrigation canal running through the reserved lands. The company&#x27;s first project was the Sunnyside Canal. While it managed to outlast the Panic of 1893, the canal had lost the financial backing of the Northern Pacific during this time. Lack of funds and poor regulatory practices forced the people of Franklin, Benton, Kittitas and Yakima Counties to request government intervention. The United States Reclamation Service--begun in 1902 to oversee water projects in the West--agreed to take over the &quot;Yakima Project&quot; in 1905. Within five years it had regulated use, built diversion dams, and extended the Sunnyside canal. It was the first of many large projects the Reclamation Service installed in the west.",

This Township (north half withdrawn from entry by &quot;E&quot; Dec. 11, 1906 for adjustment of Indian allotments.&quot; Some sections withdrawn for Colville Forest Reserve. The Colville Indian Reservation was set up in 1872 in northeast Washington. Just a few months later, following the discovery of gold in the area and upon settler&#x27;s insistence, President Grant signed an Executive Order that reduced the boundaries of the reservation in half. The Indians received the &quot;south half&quot; while the settlers kept the coveted &quot;north half&quot;. This map shows a section of the &quot;north half&quot; of the reservation lands. The federal government then opened the north half for mining entry in 1896. In reality, however, a number of settlers laid claim to the land, plowing fields and setting irrigation ditches--to the extent that in a very short time residents of the south half contended with water shortages. This intense migration continued and then surged in 1900, when the government officially opened the area to homesteads. With growth came serious concern over the welfare of the streams and forests of the region. While President Benjamin Harrison had signed in the Forest Service Act in 1891 to create forest reserves, only the Priest River Reserve (1897) in northeast Washington and northern Idaho had been established. By the presidential term of conservation-minded Theodore Roosevelt, pressure groups from around the country were against setting aside any more lands. A much needed agriculture appropriations bill even stipulated that no more lands could be reserved for this purpose. However, Roosevelt authorized the Colville Forest Reserve on March 1st, 1907--just before signing the ag bill. The Colville Forest Reserve originally held over 700,000 acres, but wording found within the 1906 Forest Homestead Act gave settlers previously living on land claims within the proposed forest acreage the right to remain on their property and the reserve was reduced consequently. Perhaps this map was drawn to locate such land claims. For more information on the development of the US Forest Service in general and the Colville National Forest in Particular, consult Craig E. Holstine&#x27;s &quot;Forgotten Corner: A History of the Colville National Forest, Washington&quot;.",

Owen. &quot;This map indicates nothing more than a proposed general plan of development of lands thereon designated.&quot; Proposed camp site and St. Helens Inn hand drawn in color. The town of Longview lies at the confluence of the Columbia and Cowlitz Rivers in western Washington, ninety miles from the Pacific Ocean. The town is a rare example of a privately funded city that was planned completely before any structure was put up or any resident lived there. It began out of the necessity of the Long-Bell Lumber Company to branch find a replacement timber source. By 1918, clear-cutting of Long-Bell lands in the south had completely used up this supply of timber. What they found was a section of old growth trees in 23,851 acres which they purchased from the Weyerhaeuser Corp. They added acreage in the surrounding area until the total rose to some 70,000 acres! The president of the company, Mr. Alexander Long, chose the Washington site for originally one, and then two mills as the acreage was added. Realizing that 14,000 workers would be needed to handle two mills and that these workers would require homes and a community, Long ordered a survey of the land in 1921. He then hired two veteran city planning professionals--George B. Kessler (of St. Louis) and Hare &amp; Hare (of Kansas City) to plan for a predicted population of 75,000. They did, and the town was finished in 1923. One of the housing developments, St. Helens Inn, is colored blue on this map. A row of five, two-story houses, the Inn boarded single men who worked for the mill. Longview incorporated in 1924, one year before this map was published. Among the celebrities that came to visit the town in promotional stints were Queen Marie of Rumania (in 1926), the Reverend Billy Sunday (in 1924) and Aimee Semple McPherson&#x27;s mother--Minnie, or &quot;Ma&quot;, Kennedy (in 1931).",

Before the creation of the Walla Walla District on November 1, 1948, all work done by the War Department&#x27;s Corp of Engineers on waterways in the west was handled by the district headquarters in Portland, Oregon. Most jobs done under this district pertained to navigational concerns. However, by the 1930s, the Corps would involve themselves in all types of water uses--including the erection of dams for hydropower. The Walla Walla District built eight dams on the Columbia and Snake River systems. During the time this map was rendered (1955), the Walla Walla District was busy constructing four dams on the Snake River, as part of the Lower Snake River Project (authorized in 1945). The Corps had just completed the McNary Dam and Locks on the Columbia River in 1954 and were working on other projects within their district boundary--as shown here. The Walla Walla District is nearly the same as the boundaries of the Snake River watershed--infiltrating six states (Washington, Oregon and parts of Idaho, Wyoming, Nevada and Utah) and 107,000 square miles.",

Cram, a Union soldier who fought in Sherman&#x27;s Army during the Civil War, returned home in 1867 to Evanston, Illinois to begin a map and atlas company with his uncle, Rufus Blanchard. By 1875, Cram owned his own publishing company in Chicago and soon rose to success by using a wax engraving process (such as perfected by the Rand McNally Company, his greatest competitor). Invented in 1834 by Richard Cary Morse and Henry A. Munson, the wax engraving process--also known as &quot;cerography&quot;--was not patented until 1848. This allowed for many engravers to perfect their own version of the method. Among them was the Rand McNally Co., which began printing maps in 1872, using a combination of Morse&#x27;s wax process and electrotyping. Invented in Russia, 1839 by a German named Jacobi, electrotyping took wax engraving one step further by coating the surface with a substance such as graphite (electrically conductive) and then submerging it all into an electrolytic bath and copper coating. When ready, the wax was then removed and the copper plate became the template for printing. While of less quality than lithography, it also cost less. By the 1890s most American publishing houses used this wax process. Cram retired in 1921, selling out to the National Map Company. In 1928, the company returned to the Cram name and it has continued in business to this day.",

The town lay on the banks of the Okanogan River, six miles north of Okanogan and thirty miles from the Columbia River confluence. That same year, the U.S. Reclamation Service was working on the Conconully Dam Irrigation Project, which would bring water from the Salmon River near the town of Conconully, and irrigate some 10,000 acres in the Omak and Okanogan region.",

By 1906, Ross had helped to organize the first accredited school district east of the Cascade Mountains and named it the Omak School District. Taking twenty acres from his own farm and platting it into a twenty five town lots in 1906, Ross also pointed the town toward the direction of incorporation and was its first and most earnest boosters. He drafted this map for use in its development. The town lay on the bank of the Okanogan River, about thirty miles north from its confluence with the Columbia River and about six miles north of the town of Okanogan. Also incorporated in 1907, Okanogan was Omak&#x27;s rival, particularly in the fight for County Seat when the position moved from Conconully in 1915. Okanogan won the seat, but both towns profited from the Conconully Dam Irrigation Project. The U.S. Reclamation Project began in 1907 and the dam was completed in 1910. When the irrigation canals were set in place within the next decade, the project watered over 10,000 acres in the vicinity of Okanogan and Omak. It has continued to prosper with the fruit industry.",

Indian Reservation Boundaries and forest reserves shown. &quot;Size of type indicates relative importance of places.&quot; Idaho was originally part of the Oregon Territory, then part of the Washington Territory when that was created out of Oregon in 1853. The Idaho Territory was further created out of Washington in 1863, and Idaho&#x27;s eastern borders were finalized by the creation of the Montana Territory in 1864 and the Wyoming Territory in 1868. Statehood finally came about in 1890. Statehood had been far from inevitable, as anti-Mormon feeling (among other factors) had led to several pushes for northern Idaho to become part of Washington State, and also for south-western Idaho to become part of the State of Nevada. One supposition is that this never came about because the northerners and south-westerners both needed each other against the Mormons. Had either been allowed to leave, the Mormons would have gained political control of what remained of Idaho. Also of note on this map is the large number of towns in northern Idaho which no longer exist. As the mining industry lost its vitality, a number of towns in the northern end of the state were reduced to ghost town status.",

When French trappers came to the region they called the area &quot;Le Peleuse&quot;, or grassland country. The term now is used not only for the region, but a town and river as well. The town of Palouse lies on the south fork of the Palouse River. Modoc Smith and W.P. Breeding laid claims there in 1875, and the town (also known at that time as Palouse City) held a post office just two years later. By the 1890s, Palouse was a major trade area. The town also supported a healthy sawmill business and farming economy. The Northern Pacific Railroad arrived in 1888 and the town incorporated that same year.",

At first the community was known as Fork of the Creek (Hangman Creek), but Mr. Traux&#x27;s wife looked out from her porch one day to find a sea of tents. It reminded her of a story in the Bible which told of Tekoa--a &quot;city of tents&quot; and suggested the town be named after it. Tekoa housed a roundhouse and main depot for the Northern Pacific Railroad and quickly grew with its support. However, it also had a more diversified economy than some of the other railroad towns, such as Malden, and was able to withstand the rail&#x27;s decline in the 1980s. It remains a small town in Whitman County today.",

Perkins. (Perkins&#x27; first name for the area, Belleville, was in honor of his girlfriend at the time. He changed the name when they were no longer together.) Colfax incorporated in 1879 and began as a cattle raising and logging/lumber town. Many people believed the land was not suitable for farming. This all changed by the 1880s, however, with the first crop of winter wheat. As the county seat for Whitman County, Colfax resented being overlooked for the site of Washington State&#x27;s new land-grant college. This honor was bestowed upon the town of Pullman in 1892.",

Evans bought three acres of land, and in three years had encouraged the development of the town so well that it held a two story hotel (the Cliff House), a general store, lumber store, livery stable, post office, school and even a cruise boat business that toured the lake. The Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul ran its line on a trestle above town. However, in 1911 a lawyer for the railroad--Mr. Marshall K. Snell--bought land from the Ewan family living a few miles beyond and the entire town was moved there. Rock Lake City changed its name to Ewan just one year after this map was published. The town of Lamont is another town located near the eleven small lakes lying west of Rock Lake. It was named after a vice president of the Northern Pacific Railroad--Mr. Daniel Lamont. Other sources claim that the town is named after Thomas W. Lamont of Stanford Oil, but this has never been confirmed. The town began in 1907 and held a post office and was incorporated just one short year later. A new school was erected in 1910, but with the consolidation of the railroad lines and the transfer of a number of resident employees to other job locations, the school consolidated with Sprague in 1960.",

Named after a nearby creek at Union Flat, the town of Penawawa lay twelve miles west of Almota. Its first permanent settler, Mr. Ed Johnson, arrived in 1871 and raised cattle. In 1872, the territorial road running from Walla Walla to Colville stopped at the settlement and helped its economy greatly. It was platted in 1877 by founders Emsley Flincher, C.C. Cram and Francis Marion Byrd. Cram owned a ferry business on the other side of the Snake River and Penawawa grew as a ferry station and an exchange station that kept fresh horses for the stage coach route from Spokane to Pendleton. It was widely used until the highway was built and bypassed Penawawa for Central Ferry instead. There was also a railroad in the vicinity, located near Camas Prairie Road. The Penawawa post office was in existence from 1872 to 1937. Their school, which had begun sometime before 1890, consolidated with Colfax in 1940. The cemetery was also moved to Colfax (1960) due to the likelihood of water levels rising from construction (beginning 1963)of the Little Goose Dam.",

The post office, railroad station and general store all lay on Front Street, with the school on South and 3rd. By the time of this plat map, 1910, the Columbia and Palouse Railroad was replaced by(or perhaps incorporated into) the larger Oregon Railway and Navigation Company. Many hypotheses have been given regarding the origin of the Pampa name. Some suggest that it refers to the pampas-like grass of the region. Others guess that someone--perhaps David S.

In 1881, the newly formed Garfield County held its county seat at Pataha City for one year. It transferred the next year three miles away to Pomeroy, Washington, but the fact that Pataha City held the honor even temporarily shows that the town was strong and growing at that point in time. The name Pataha is a Nez Perce word that means &quot;bushy creek&quot;. The town incorporated in 1875, as more and more people began to settle there. It became a popular spot after the arrival of three economies: the shipping/transportation industry, winter wheat farming, and flour production. The Pataha-Alpowa stage line stopped in the town, and a shipping business running the Snake River was also established some time after. Prior to 1870, Pataha was mostly a cattle raising region, but soon prospered as a farming town with the introduction of a hearty strain of wheat. The future looked bright for Pataha until 1886. In that year the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company built a track running up to the town of Pomeroy and greatly improved transportation methods in the area. However, Pomeroy had long been Pataha City&#x27;s rival, and refused to extend the line into the next town. Pataha City withered away when more and more businesses and farmers switched from shipping transport to the rails. The gristmill business (the Houser Mill or Pataha Flour Mill for example) continued on for a number of years due to a high international demand for its quality product. However, it too closed down by 1940, when the federal government placed costly and rigid regulations on small businesses.",

See the other part of Pullman: http://content.libraries.wsu.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/maps/id/334 The village of Pullman incorporated in 1888, about a decade after its first settlers (Mr. Bolin Farr, Mr. D.G. Mckenzie, and Mr. Charles Moore) arrived in the geographical area then known as &quot;Three Forks&quot;. Once there, a number of settlers decided to stay and try their hands at farming, cattle grazing, mining, and the trade business. Stories have been passed down through the years that the town was named in honor of Mr. George Pullman of the Pullman Car Company, but these reports have yet to be verified. What is known is that at the time of the town&#x27;s incorporation some two hundred souls resided there. A number of diverse businesses in the area helped the young town stay afloat, and even boast (and win) the argument that their town was the best location for the State&#x27;s land-grant college. Some of the first businesses in the area included the Pullman Drug Store, owned by White and Johnson, Martin Zender&#x27;s blacksmith shop, the Downen and Mills&#x27; Dry Goods Store, a real estate and insurance agency also owned by Mr. E.E. Downen, a Grocery store run by Ellsworth and Hunt, the &quot;Mint&quot; Saloon run by Mike Leitch, and the Palace Hotel and a livery stable run by Mr. M.C. True. The Columbia and Palouse Railway (later taken over by the Oregon-Washington Railroad and Navigation Company) came to town in 1885, and was joined shortly by the Spokane and Palouse Railroad (1887) and the greatest coup of all, the Northern Pacific Railroad in 1890.",

See the other part of Pullman: http://content.libraries.wsu.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/maps/id/333 Some speculation has arisen over the longstanding story regarding Pullman&#x27;s inception and bestowed name. Prior to 1899 and the publishing of the first historical sketch of the town by resident Judge Thomas Neill, pioneer stories listed D.G. McKenzie as the first white man to settle in the area. After Neill&#x27;s history, the notion crept into the historical record that it was in fact Mr. Bolin Farr who first settled and then platted ten acres for the townsite. Another discrepancy stated that Pullman was originally named &quot;Three Forks&quot;, after the nearby junction of two creeks and with the Palouse River. However, Lawrence Stark, archivist of Manuscripts, Archives and Special Collections at Washington State University&#x27;s Holland Library, suggests that this is merely the geographical name for the area on which the town of Pullman is situated, and not the original name of the actual town at all. He further disagrees with the likelihood that the town was named after Pullman Car Company President, George Pullman. Some facts regarding the early town are certain however, such as the its incorporation in 1888. The town lay originally on several hills, with today&#x27;s College Hill then known as &quot;Mechanic&#x27;s Hill&quot; and Military Hill then known as &quot;College Hill&quot;. The original College Hill Addition (1890) is the site of the first college to arrive in Pullman--a military school begun in 1891. Apparently, the military school was academically well regarded, and preferred even over the State land-grant school when it enrolled its first students in 1892. However, the military college burned down in early 1893, and with the growing State College in such close proximity, it seemed pointless to rebuild. The name of &quot;Military Hill&quot; however, keeps the school in memory.",

While the boundaries and geography of the United States is somewhat skewed, the map does include inset pictures of scenic places found along the track. The Transcontinental Railroad took four years to complete (1865-1869). Stretching some 1,700 miles, the Central Pacific pushed east from Sacramento as the Union Pacific left Omaha, Nebraska and traveled through the Platte River Valley. The two lines met at the summit of Promontory Point near Ogden, Utah on May 10, 1869 and helped unite the country both physically and mentally. While Washington State is represented only minimally on this rendering, the map in fact came from a pamphlet selling points of interest for Washington and Oregon. The &quot;Columbia Tours&quot; as they were called included special promotional rates for traveling north out of Portland to four destinations, including Alaska, the Cascade Mountains, and Crater Lake. The trip from Portland to Seattle took three hours.",

The Railroad never made it to Snoqualmie Pass, much less to Walla Walla. It did make it up the valley as far as Renton (in 1877) and Newcastle (in 1878), at which point it became primarily a coal railroad, transporting enormous quantities of coal down from the Newcastle mines to the Seattle docks at a greatly reduced transport cost. The Seattle and Walla Walla Railroad was purchased by the Columbia and Puget Sound Railroad in 1881.",

        "description": "1 map; 14 x 23 cm. The first railroad to stretch across the United States, the Union Pacific Railroad, was completed in just four years--from 1865 to 1869. This map was in fact printed one year before the completion of the road. Linking up with the Central Pacific, the transcontinental railroad ran from Omaha, Nebraska to Sacramento, California, some 1,700 miles of track. The laborers of the Union Pacific worked at a staggering pace in all kinds of weather and dangerous conditions. Still, under the direction of construction manager and Vice President Thomas C. Durant and the expertise of Chief Engineer Grenville Dodge, the men laid a mile of track per day--sometimes more. The Central Pacific and the Union Pacific met on May 10, 1869, at the summit of Promontory Point near Ogden, Utah. Note the branch line for the Puget Sound. The Oregon Short Line of the Oregon-Washington Railroad and Navigation Company would connect the Union Pacific to the northwest in 1884. In a sense, not only did the line link the nation physically and commercially, but the idea of traveling from the Atlantic to the Pacific Coasts in just ten short days united the nation as a people as well.",

Map shows Northern Pacific Main Line, Northern Pacific Branches, Oregon and Transcontinental Lines, Oregon Railway and Navigation Company Lines, and uncompleted roads. After the initial burst of construction by the Northern Pacific in 1870-1871 a faltering economy began to affect the Railroad, and by 1872 financial disaster had occurred and construction was halted. In 1873, the company failed in a financial panic. Between 1873 and 1875, the company was reorganized and refinanced, and earnings from the transportation of coal along existing routes allowed the company to keep its head above water and even turn a slight profit. In 1879, new financing was arranged, and work began along almost the entire route. The Northern Pacific&#x27;s transcontinental route was finally finished in 1883, nineteen years after the Congressional act which originally created it. The two other rail companies shown here were both partners with the Northern Pacific at this time. The Oregon Railway and Navigation had previously constructed its own tracks along the Columbia, and in 1880 the Northern Pacific achieved a temporary arrangement with them to use their tracks while constructing their own. Seeing his railroad&#x27;s demise in a competing Northern Pacific route, the President of the OR&amp;N, Henry Villard, conducted a successful takeover of the Northern Pacific. The Oregon and Transcontinental was created by Villard to facilitate the cooperative operation of the two railways.",

The Olympian was unique in the northwest in using electric motors to power itself over the passes in Montana and Washington.

They printed many pamphlets such as this one, extolling the nature of the northwest and the benefits of the railroad itself. The railroad held huge land grants, extending up to fifty miles to either side of the prospective tracks, and as such it was in the business of trying to sell the land to future settlers, prospectors, miners, or whomever would buy. Most of the transcontinental route on this map is still in the planning stages at this time- by the end of 1871 track had only reached as far west as Fargo, North Dakota.",

The Washington State Highway Department was created in 1905, though the state Legislature had been attempting to create state roads as early as 1893. The first concrete and asphalt roads were created in 1912. 1920 saw the first laws requiring licensing and registration of motor vehicles and their operators. 1921 saw the first gas tax, with income from both sources going to highway funding. At the time of this map, the state speed limit was 30 miles per hour. This map shows projected construction for the succeeding 12 years- not all of these highways were completed, and several not pictured here were completed in that time span.",

Ross, an employee of the Great Northern Railroad, settled with his family in the area that became the town of Omak, Washington. By 1906, Ross had helped to organize the first accredited school district east of the Cascade Mountains and named it the Omak School District. Taking twenty acres from his own farm and platting it into a twenty five town lots in 1906, Ross also pointed the town toward the direction of incorporation and was its first and most earnest boosters. He drafted this map for use in its development. The town lay on the bank of the Okanogan River, about thirty miles north from its confluence with the Columbia River and about six miles north of the town of Okanogan. Also incorporated in 1907, Okanogan was Omak&#x27;s rival, particularly in the fight for County Seat when the position moved from Conconully in 1915. Okanogan won the seat, but both towns profited from the Conconully Dam Irrigation Project. The U.S. Reclamation Project began in 1907 and the dam was completed in 1910. When the irrigation canals were set in place within the next decade, the project watered over 10,000 acres in the vicinity of Okanogan and Omak. It has continued to prosper with the fruit industry.",

This is the front and back covers of a brochure published by the US Forest Service. It was promoting the leasing of Forest Service land for the construction of summer homes. The Lake Chelan area was first settled in approximately 1886, and is renowned for its beauty and for its relative inaccessibility. It was proposed for National Park status as early as 1892, though private interests (settling, recreation, logging, and mining) always derailed these efforts. Though mining failed due to the difficulties involved in getting ores out of the area, the area became enormously popular for recreation. Anti-logging efforts in the 1950s and 1960s led to the creation of the Lake Chelan National Recreation Area and the North Cascades National Park (bordering the Lake Chelan NRA to the north) in 1968.",

Ross, an employee of the Great Northern Railroad, settled with his family in the area that became the town of Omak, Washington. By 1906, Ross had helped to organize the first accredited school district east of the Cascade Mountains and named it the Omak School District. Taking twenty acres from his own farm and platting it into a twenty five town lots in 1906, Ross also pointed the town toward the direction of incorporation and was its first and most earnest boosters. He drafted this map for use in its development. The town lay on the bank of the Okanogan River, about thirty miles north from its confluence with the Columbia River and about six miles north of the town of Okanogan. Also incorporated in 1907, Okanogan was Omak&#x27;s rival, particularly in the fight for County Seat when the position moved from Conconully in 1915. Okanogan won the seat, but both towns profited from the Conconully Dam Irrigation Project. The U.S. Reclamation Project began in 1907 and the dam was completed in 1910. When the irrigation canals were set in place within the next decade, the project watered over 10,000 acres in the vicinity of Okanogan and Omak. It has continued to prosper with the fruit industry.",

Two further volumes were later produced, one in 1922 and the other in 1933. With multiple transcontinental railroads now in existence, and having been so for a few decades, transcontinental tourism had become accessible to the general public. These guidebooks provided both maps and a running text describing the geological and historical significance of the route the railway followed. The self-stated intent of the guides was to &quot;encourage many thousand of Americans to study geography at first hand&quot; and to &quot;stimulate the eye in the selection of the essentials in the scene that so rapidly unfolds itself in the crossing of the continent.&quot; These maps come from Volume A, &quot;The Northern Pacific with a side trip to Yellowstone Park.&quot;",

They printed many pamphlets such as this one, extolling the nature of the northwest and the benefits of the railroad itself. The railroad held huge land grants, extending up to fifty miles to either side of the prospective tracks, and as such it was in the business of trying to sell the land to future settlers, prospectors, miners, or whomever would buy. Most of the transcontinental route on this map is still in the planning stages at this time- by the end of 1871 track had only reached as far west as Fargo, North Dakota.",

It read, in part, &quot;The President of the United States may, from time to time, set apart and reserve, in any State or Territory having public land bearing forests, in any part of the public lands wholly or in part covered with timber or undergrowth, whether of commercial value or not, as public reservations; and the President shall, by public proclamation, declare the establishment of such reservations and the limits thereof.&quot; By the time he left office, President Benjamin Harrison had set aside 14 million acres of land under this act. The initial effect of this was to allow the government to remove large tracts of forest from public access entirely, but in 1897 an act was passed that allowed the government to manage these lands, and so at government discretion they were made available for logging, grazing, and other uses. The act was initially used to set aside land protecting watersheds, to preserve &#x27;recreational&#x27; forests, and to provide for a long-term renewable timber resource.",

A hand colored map including the Oregon Territory --comprising the area that would later split into Washington Territory in 1853. The map also includes the recently formed State of California. Its population boomed following the discovery of gold in 1848 and the rush of 49ers into the area the next year. Note also Utah Territory. Worried by the streaming mass of miners coming into the area in 1849, the Mormons invited Europeans interested in their faith(particularly from England) to come and populate Utah. This map is numbered 144 from Joseph Meyer&#x27;s &quot;Meyer&#x27;s Hand Atlas&quot;, published by the Bibliographic Institution of Hildburghausen (Germany).",

Colton in the Clerk&#x27;s Office of the District Court for the Southern District of New York.&quot; Prime meridians: Greenwich and Washington. Originally folded, in cover 16 x 11 cm. The approximate date of this map is easily distinguishable in a quick glance, as the Idaho Territory was formed out of the Washington Territory in 1863, and subsequently split into the Idaho and Montana Territories just one year later, in 1864. Also of note on this map are the Nevada borders, which are at this time further west and north than they are in present day. The Nevada Territory was created in 1861, extended into Utah in 1862, statehood was granted in 1864, and then the State was extended further into both Utah and Arizona in 1866. Nevada&#x27;s rush to Statehood came about mostly due to the Union&#x27;s need of tax revenue from the extensive silver mines there to finance its actions in the Civil War. The expansion into the Arizona and Utah territories (moving the western Nevada border from 117 degrees west longitude to 114 degrees and south through Arizona along the Colorado) came about from the desire to place a strategically important pass, located just east of then sleepy Las Vegas on the Old Spanish Trail, inside incorporated United States territory, and outside of both Mormon and notoriously lawless Arizonan hands.",

Text from the verso: FOREST CONDITIONS OF THE SEATTLE QUADRANGLE. This land-classification sheet, representing the Seattle quadrangle, shows the area which at the time of survey, in 1894-95, was covered with woods, and the area estimated to contain timber of merchantable size and quantity, which, as defined by the practice in Washington, includes trees having a butt diameter of 20 inches or more, with a length below branches of at least 32 feet. It shows, furthermore, the portions of the quadrangle which have been cut over or culled for lumber or clearing, and the area which has been burned. As is seen, most, if not all, of these areas have, since the cutting and burning, commenced to become reforested. The areas naturally devoid of forests are also indicated. The total area of this quadrangle is 804 square miles. Of this the land area is estimated at 565 square miles, 239 square miles being occupied by Puget Sound and its arms and by Washington and Sammamish lakes and other smaller bodies of water. This land was formerly covered with forests of merchantable timber, with the exception of some 20 square miles of swamp lands in the valley of Snohomish River and at the head of Elliot Bay, near Seattle, which were naturally without forests. Of this timbered area of 545 square miles, there have been cut or culled for lumber, or cleared for settlement, not less than 330 square miles, and there have been burned 40 square miles. Thus, since settlement began in this region the timber has been destroyed on an area of 370 square miles, or two-thirds of the area formerly forested, leaving only 175 square miles in merchantable forests. On most of the land thus denuded timber is growing again, so that the wooded area, including all land on which wood is growing, comprises not less than 495 square miles, or 88 per cent of the entire land area. The areas not wooded consist of those naturally without forests, the sites and suburbs of the towns and cities, and the numerous little farms scattered over the quadrangle.The area covered with merchantable timber is estimated to contain 1,653,246,000 feet B.M. of fir, almost entirely red fir (Pseudotsuga taxifolia), and 783,299,000 feet B.M. of cedar, mainly Thuja plicata, a total of 2,436,475,000 feet B.M. The merchantable timber consists almost entirely of these two species, and more than two-thirds of it is red fir. The average stand of timber upon this area is about 22,000 feet per acre, a heavy stand even for this heavily timbered part of the country. This region, which is blessed with a heavy rainfall and a humid atmosphere, is especially favorable to tree growth, and wherever the forests have been destroyed the reproduction is rapid, and the species which succeed are usually identical with those destroyed.

Diagram depicts which topographers were responsible for which areas of the map. Land classification surveyed in 1897. &quot;Contour interval 50 feet.

This land classification sheet, representing the Tacoma quadrangle, shows the area which at the time of survey, in 1894-95, was covered with woods, and the areas containing timber of merchantable size and quality, which, as defined by the practice in Washington, includes trees having a butt diameter of 20 inches or more, with a length below branches of at least 32 feet. It shows, furthermore, the portions of the quadrangle which have been cut over or culled for lumber or clearing, and those which have been burned. As is seen, most of these areas have, since the cutting and burning, commenced to become reforested. The areas naturally devoid of forests are also indicated, including a few square miles at the head of Commencement Bay, a small area in the valley of White River, and a large area south of Tacoma. The last is an area of approximately level land, covered by coarse glacial deposits, in which the copious rainfall rapidly sinks, making it, to all intents and purposes, an arid soil. It is because of this feature of the soil that the region is largely open and park-like. It contains scattered groves of trees, largely composed of lodgepole pine, a species here of no merchantable value. The trees are of small size, and branch nearly to the ground. The total area of this quadrangle is 812 square miles. Of this the land area is approximately 737 square miles, the remainder being included in Puget Sound and a few small lakes. With the exception of the areas above mentioned which are naturally timberless or are covered with lodgepole pine, and which include about 105 square miles, the land area was formerly covered with forest of merchantable timber. Of this timbered area of 632 square miles, there have been cut or culled for lumber, or cleared for settlement, about 200 square miles, and there have been burned 143 square miles, leaving in standing merchantable timber only 289 square miles. Thus, since settlement began in this region, timber has been destroyed over an area of 343 square miles, or 54 per cent of the area formerly forested. On all the areas thus denuded timber is growing again, except where the land has been cultivated: so that the wooded area, including all lands on which wood is growing, comprises not less than 560 square miles, or 76 per cent of the land area of the quadrangle. The areas not now wooded consist not only of those naturally without forests, as above specified, but the sites and suburbs of the towns and cities and the numerous farms scattered over the quadrangle. The area covered with merchantable timber is estimated to contain the following amount, in feet B.M.: Red fir (Pseudotsuga taxifolia), 1,686,900,000 feet; spruce (Picea sitchensis), 5,447,000 feet; cedar (Thuja plicata), 374,397,000 feet; hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana), 22,429,000 feet; total, 2,089,173,000 feet. Four-fifths of the above amount of timber consists of red fir, and nearly all the remainder of cedar, the amount of spruce and hemlock being insignificant. The average stand of timber upon the timbered area of this quadrangle is but little over 11,000 feet B.M. per acre, a stand only about half as great as that of the Seattle quadrangle, immediately north of it. This region, lying in the Sound valley, at the head of that sheet of water, is blessed with an ample rainfall and a humid atmosphere, which are especially favorable to tree growth; so that wherever forests have been destroyed their reproduction is rapid, and the species which succeed are usually identical with those destroyed.

Father Pierre Jean De Smet came to the northwest in 1840, as a &quot;black robe&quot; missionary to the Flathead Indians. With them, he traveled through Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana until 1841, when he was appointed Superior of the Oregon Missions. He remained at that post until 1846, after which he returned east. This is an English translation of a De Smet map which was originally done in De Smet&#x27;s native French.

Shows predominant mineral for each mining district. &quot;Plate 15&quot;--Map has been cut from larger sheet. Mounted on cloth backing. George Otis Smith, later director of the U.S. Geological Survey, actually has a hand in surveying the geography of Washington State. In the early 1900s, Smith was part of a team of surveyors sent to study the American-Canadian border when the two neighbors agreed to have the border resurveyed. For most of the 1800s, maps had focused on land in terms of acquiring access (railroads, trails), and assuring settlement. With the interest engendered by the Californian and Alaskan gold rushes of the latter half of that century, maps began to focus on the geologic aspects of the northwest as well.",

The discovery of coal in the local hills provided impetus for further growth, and the prospect (which proved false, in the end, due to the impassability of the mountains to the east) of the area being the western terminus for the transcontinental Great Northern Railroad pushed a boom. In 1890, the nearby town of Sehome was merged into Whatcom, while two other nearby towns, Fairhaven and Bellingham, combined as Fairhaven. In 1903 Whatcom and Fairhaven incorporated into one town, taking the mutually acceptable name of Bellingham. Lake Whatcom is located approximately 3 miles east of Whatcom/Bellingham.",

Originally named Alkali (after the Alkali Canyon, which it was located at the mouth of), the name was changed to Arlington in 1885 when the town was incorporated. The origin of the name Arlington is uncertain- it is presumed to be either after a prominent resident, Nathan Arlington Cornish, or after Arlington, VA in honor of that town&#x27;s prominent resident of the day, southern General Robert E.

The town of Snohomish began, loosely, in 1859 when three men filed land claims at the spot where a proposed military road from Fort Steilacoom to Fort Bellingham was to cross the Snohomish River. Though the military road was never fully completed to the north, Snohomish still became the major center of the area as a result of the crossing. Snohomish was considered the area&#x27;s major center for many years to come. Gradually the distinction turned to Everett, located five miles to the northeast on the Puget Sound. However, at the time pictured here, Snohomish was still the most important town. The railroad bridge pictured on the right here was completed on September 22, 1888, and cemented the towns importance as a lumber center. The insets: The Blackman Block was the home of Blackman Bros., a general merchandise store, as well as a jeweler, a confectioner, and several lawyers. The Eye was the Snohomish newspaper. Cathcart Hall was briefly the home of the first Snohomish bank.",

Scanned from: History of the Pacific Northwest : Oregon and Washington. Portland, Or. : North Pacific History Co., 1889. v. 2, p. 422 In 1881, the newly formed Garfield County held its county seat at Pataha City for one year. It transferred the next year three miles away to Pomeroy, Washington, but the fact that Pataha City held the honor even temporarily shows that the town was strong and growing at that point in time. The name Pataha is a Nez Perce word that means &quot;bushy creek&quot;. The town incorporated in 1875, as more and more people began to settle there. It became a popular spot after the arrival of three economies: the shipping/transportation industry, winter wheat farming, and flour production. The Pataha-Alpowa stage line stopped in the town, and a shipping business running the Snake River was also established some time after. Prior to 1870, Pataha was mostly a cattle raising region, but soon prospered as a farming town with the introduction of a hearty strain of wheat. The future looked bright for Pataha until 1886. In that year the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company built a track running up to the town of Pomeroy and greatly improved transportation methods in the area. However, Pomeroy had long been Pataha City&#x27;s rival, and refused to extend the line into the next town. Pataha City withered away when more and more businesses and farmers switched from shipping transport to the rails. The gristmill business (the Houser Mill or Pataha Flour Mill for example) continued on for a number of years due to a high international demand for its quality product. However, it too closed down by 1940, when the federal government placed costly and rigid regulations on small businesses.",

Benton County is best known as the site where the Atomic Energy Commission placed its Hanford site in 1943, six years after this map, for the continuation of the Manhattan Project and the researching and construction of the first nuclear bombs. The Hanford site occupied the portion of Benton County lying, very approximately, east of a north-south line drawn between Cold Creek and Prosser, and north of the east-west line marked &quot;T 10 N&quot; on this map. Towns already in existence in that area, Hanford and White Bluff being the largest two, were evacuated. The government issued &quot;declaration of taking&quot; documents to those living there, basically giving residents somewhere between 2 days and 90 days to pack and relocate. Residents were reimbursed based on an assessment of property values established by an external assessor. Those few residents who remained did so as government employees providing services to the AEC, and paid rent to the government for the use of what had previously been their own land. Even the cemeteries were removed to Prosser. Native Americans who used fishing grounds on the Columbia within the area refused any payment, and eventually those in charge allowed the Indians to continue fishing there. However, to do so, those fishing had to agree to be trucked in by the government, and were under armed guard while within the Hanford boundaries. At present, nothing remains of the town of White Bluffs- all the buildings have been removed or destroyed, and only the foundations remain to indicate that a town (and a somewhat important Columbia River crossing) ever existed there.",

With the connection of this route as the primary connection to the east for the northwest, south-eastern Washington would began to undergo a minor boom due to the influx of settlers that would follow.",

Scanned from: Annual report of the Board of Indian Commissioners to the Secretary of the Interior 1876 In 1855, The Nez Perce tribes signed a Treaty at Camp Stevens in Oregon which limited their tribal lands to those areas shown in color on this map. In 1863, a new Treaty was negotiated, restricting Nez Perce lands even further, to the area shown in blue on this map. This Treaty was a source of great disagreement among the Nez Perce- many opposed it, and many Chiefs refused to sign it. These non-signers would provide the basis for further difficulties, as many Nez Perce did not consider themselves bound by the Treaty, though the American government considered them to be so. The Indian argument was convincing enough that in 1873 President Grant restored to the Nez Perce the territory shown in yellow in addition to their pre-existing reservation (blue). The government soon revoked its own proclamation, however, and the Indians were ordered off the lands. The Indians were given thirty days to depart, but confrontations between impatient settlers and unhappy evictees grew to conflicts, and the Nez Perce War began in 1877.",

Two further volumes were later produced, one in 1922 and the other in 1933. With multiple transcontinental railroads now in existence, and having been so for a few decades, transcontinental tourism had become accessible to the general public. These guidebooks provided both maps and a running text describing the geological and historical significance of the route the railway followed. The self-stated intent of the guides was to &quot;encourage many thousand of Americans to study geography at first hand&quot; and to &quot;stimulate the eye in the selection of the essentials in the scene that so rapidly unfolds itself in the crossing of the continent.&quot; These maps come from Volume D, &quot;Shasta Route and Coast Line.&quot;",

        "description": "1 map: col., 18 x 21 cm. Before the arrival to Washington State of the first irrigation projects handled by the U.S. Reclamation Service, the Northern Pacific Railroad and other railway companies funded private irrigation projects in the Columbia River Basin. Their efforts stemmed from a desire to see the entire state in top production and farming communities everywhere in need of railroad shipping services. This map shows the Inland Empire and more importantly, the Columbia Basin Irrigation Project at one of its most crucial times of Empire consisted of eastern Washington, northern Idaho, and northeast Oregon from between the Cascade Mountains to the Rocky Mountains. Within it lay &quot;Big Bend&quot; country--the region farmers flocked to when Palouse land was no longer available. (On this map it is shaded a dark green) For this reason, Big Bend was also known as the &quot;Empire within an Empire&quot;. It held some 2,800,000 acres, of which half were irrigable, lying ninety miles from north to south and sixty miles east to west. The project was much too large for one railroad company or town, or other private investor to take handle. By 1919, a number of government agencies (both state and federal) reviewed irrigation plans for the area. Among the top three were the &quot;Gravity Plan&quot;, pushed by the city of Spokane and the Washington Water Power Company, the &quot;Pumping Plan&quot; proposed by Billy Clapp of Ephrata and supported by the surveys of Mr. James O&#x27;Sullivan, and the &quot;Wenatchee Lake Plan&quot;, originating with Wenatchee Valley booster, Mr. Rufus Woods and taken on by the Quincy Valley Water Users Association. The Wenatchee Lake Plan proposed a gravity canal built from Wenatchee Lake in the mountains down to the floor of the Quincy Valley and would only water 400,000 acres. The Pumping Plan involved the erection of a dam at Grand Coulee, giving water to an estimated 1,400,000 acres in the Big Bend country to its south. This map supported the Gravity Plan, which would build a low masonry dam on Pend Oreille River at Albeni Falls, Idaho and hold the waters at Pend Oreille Lake and Priest Lake, Idaho. The reservoir lay approximately forty miles from Spokane. The water would then be sent (by gravity) through a series of canals and tunnels, siphons and aqueducts--even lakes--until it reached the Big Bend country 130 miles below. This plan predicted water for the most amount of acres (1, 750,000) and was touted as economically feasible. Throughout the 1920s, a number of survey reports weighing the feasibility of both plans were given, and approved the gravity plan over the pumping plan. However, the Corps of Engineers&#x27; &quot;308 Report&quot; compiled by Major John S. Butler, was the first to approve of the Grand Coulee (pumping plan) venture. When used as evidence in the House of Representative&#x27;s hearing by the Committee on Irrigation and Reclamation, the tide had changed and the pumping plan was approved over the gravity plan. With this approval, in 1933 President Roosevelt signed for appropriation of funds made possible by the National Industrial Recovery Act and construction on the Grand Coulee Dam began soon after.

The author of this map (and the book it comes in) was a trader in the employ of John Jacob Astor&#x27;s Pacific Fur Company, and took part in Astor&#x27;s first expedition to the northwest to establish the profitability of the fur trade there. The expedition departed by sea from New York City in late 1810, and arrived at the mouth of the Columbia River in March of 1811, where it built Fort Astoria. Over the years he spent in the northwest, he traveled the length and breadth of the future state of Washington (with the notable exception of the areas west of the Cascade Mountains), and also assisted in the building of Fort Okanogan and Fort Nez Perce. He remained in the northwest until 1823, at which point he traveled to what would later become Montana, where he would remain until his death in 1856.",

Gen. Nelson A. Miles, Thomas W. Symons traveled and closely mapped the entirety of the Columbia River from the Canadian border to the point where the Snake and Columbia Rivers met. His stated goal was &quot;to determine its navigability and the advisability of putting steamboats on it to be used in the transportation of troops, stores, supplies, &amp;c.&quot; This map consisted of this index page, the 25 more detailed maps indicated on the index, and a few smaller close-up maps of the more obstructed parts of the river. Symon&#x27;s report also included historical and geological notes on the Columbia and its basin, as well as notes on improving the navigability of the River.",

        "description": "1 map ; negative : 13 x 35 cm. Before the arrival to Washington State of the first irrigation projects handled by the U.S. Reclamation Service, the Northern Pacific Railroad and other railway companies funded private irrigation projects in the Columbia River Basin. Their efforts stemmed from a desire to see the entire state in top production and farming communities everywhere in need of railroad shipping services. The project was much too large for one railroad company or town, or other private investor to take handle. By 1919, a number of government agencies (both state and federal) reviewed irrigation plans for the area. These were shortly resolved into two possibilities: the &quot;Gravity Plan&quot;, pushed by the city of Spokane and the Washington Water Power Company, and the &quot;Pumping Plan&quot; proposed by Billy Clapp of Ephrata and supported by the surveys of Mr. James O&#x27;Sullivan. The Pumping Plan involved the erection of a dam at Grand Coulee, giving water to an estimated 1,400,000 acres in the Big Bend country to its south. This map displayed the canal route of the Gravity Plan, which would build a low masonry dam on Pend Oreille River at Albeni Falls, Idaho and hold the waters at Pend Oreille Lake and Priest Lake, Idaho. The reservoir lay approximately forty miles from Spokane. The water would then be sent (by gravity) through a series of canals and tunnels, siphons and aqueducts--even lakes--until it reached the Big Bend country 130 miles below. This plan predicted water for the most amount of acres (1, 750,000) and was touted as economically feasible. Throughout the 1920s, a number of survey reports weighing the feasibility of both plans were given, and approved the gravity plan over the pumping plan. However, the Corps of Engineers&#x27; &quot;308 Report&quot; compiled by Major John S. Butler, was the first to approve of the Grand Coulee (pumping plan) venture. When used as evidence in the House of Representative&#x27;s hearing by the Committee on Irrigation and Reclamation, the tide had changed and the pumping plan was approved over the gravity plan. With this approval, in 1933 President Roosevelt signed for appropriation of funds made possible by the National Industrial Recovery Act and construction on the Grand Coulee Dam began soon after.",

Cram, a Union soldier who fought in Sherman&#x27;s Army during the Civil War, returned home in 1867 to Evanston, Illinois to begin a map and atlas company with his uncle, Rufus Blanchard. By 1875, Cram owned his own publishing company in Chicago and soon rose to success by using a wax engraving process (such as perfected by the Rand McNally Company, his greatest competitor). Invented in 1834 by Richard Cary Morse and Henry A. Munson, the wax engraving process--also known as &quot;cerography&quot;--was not patented until 1848. This allowed for many engravers to perfect their own version of the method. Among them was the Rand McNally Co., which began printing maps in 1872, using a combination of Morse&#x27;s wax process and electrotyping. Invented in Russia, 1839 by a German named Jacobi, electrotyping took wax engraving one step further by coating the surface with a substance such as graphite (electrically conductive) and then submerging it all into an electrolytic bath and copper coating. When ready, the wax was then removed and the copper plate became the template for printing. While of less quality than lithography, it also cost less. By the 1890s most American publishing houses used this wax process. Cram retired in 1921, selling out to the National Map Company. In 1928, the company returned to the Cram name and it has continued in business to this day.",

Settlement of Tacoma (first known as Commencement Bay, or Commencement City, after the Bay on which it was located) began in 1853. An Indian War led to the evacuation of the town, and it wasn&#x27;t until the 1860s that it began to grow again, led on, as were so many Washington coastal towns, by the idea that it would be the western terminus for the cross-continental railroad. When, in 1873, the railroad did choose Tacoma as its terminus, its future was assured. The rail line was not completed until 1888, however.",

In 1906, the Duwamish river flooded so seriously that the entire floor of the Duwamish River Valley was under water and flood waters were backed up all the way to Auburn. Voters approved bonds to dredge the river and provide for flood control, and between 1912 and 1917 the river was drastically altered. Enough land was removed and enough bends straightened that the travel length of the river was reduced from 13 miles to 4 miles. The river was also drastically altered, losing nine feet of depth, in 1916 when the ship canal was opened so that Lake Washington now drained through it instead of through the Black River and into the Duwamish.",

Warre brought along his watercolors, and has provided us with a number of sketches of the area of his travels.

The name was locally changed to Concord by 1897, and finally on New Years Day, 1900, the town changed to its present name, Clarkston. In 1897, the Lewiston-Concord Bridge Company was formed with the intent of building a bridge across the Snake River between the two towns. The bridge was built in 1899, and eventually replaced in the 1930s.",

In order to make the city of Vancouver, Washington, more accessible by water up the Columbia, a proposal was adopted in 1892 to dam half the river south of Hayden Island, thus forcing water north of the island and creating a deeper channel past Vancouver. Work commenced that year and continued until April 1893, at which point the river rose and submerged both the dam and the island with only 60 feet remaining to be constructed. When the water receded, the island had been eroded such that 470 feet of dam was now needed. By the time a revetment was constructed to prevent further erosion, a total of 700 more feet of dam was required. Unfortunately, this was well beyond the original budget of the project. This map comes from a letter from the Secretary of War to the 54th Congress, effectively requesting more money so that the project could be finished.",

Sur., and from Actual Field Surveys by Henry Carr, C.E., March, 1888. This map depicts this area in its heyday. The majority of the mines here are silver mines, with a small amount of gold mining. When silver prices fell drastically in the 1890s, the area&#x27;s mines began inevitably closing. When Okanogan County was formed out of Stevens County in 1888, Ruby City (center right on the map) was made the County Seat. Some suspect this was accomplished primarily through bribery, Ruby City having the reputation of being the territory&#x27;s wildest city (one visitor termed it &quot;the Babylon of the west&quot;). The County Seat moved to Salmon City (now Conconully, lower left on the map) by election the following year. Today, nothing remains of Ruby City but a wide spot in the road and traces of old foundations. The planned town of Arlington (top center) apparently never came to fruition. It should not be confused with the city of Arlington which is now located in Snohomish County, Washington.",

The map was originally drawn Edward J. Powell and was reproduced in 1937 as British Admiralty Chart No. 579 by photolithography to accompany U.S. Treaty Series No. 918. The original engraving was done by Davies &amp; Powell.",

At one time the small community of Texas City was also known as Texas Ferry. Located on the Snake River, you can perhaps derive the town&#x27;s economic interests from this name. It lay directly across the river from Riparia and eventually melded into it. Alkali Flat Creek runs through the town as well. There were a number of shipyards located along the town&#x27;s Water Street. With shipyards and the coming of the Oregon Railway and Navigation Co., Texas City became important for trade and transportation capabilities. With completion of the Snake River Valley Railroad in 1907, Texas City also had a direct route to the Idaho border.",

The Pampa portion of the map is scaled at 400&#x27;=1&quot; and is catalogued individually at: http://content.libraries.wsu.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/maps/id/330/rec/21. The Columbia and Palouse Railroad Company&#x27;s line ran through the Pampa siding in 1883. The town grew large enough for a post office just one year later, but it only continued in operation until 1912. The post office, railroad station and general store all lay on Front Street, with the school on South and 3rd. By the time of this plat map, 1910, the Columbia and Palouse Railroad was replaced by(or perhaps incorporated into) the larger Oregon Railway and Navigation Company. Many hypotheses have been given regarding the origin of the Pampa name. Some suggest that it refers to the pampas-like grass of the region. Others guess that someone--perhaps David S. Bowman, a southerner who arrived in 1883--named the town in honor of Pampa, Texas or Pampa, Tennessee.",

Range 42 is scaled at 1 mile=2&quot;. The Penawawa portion of the map is scaled at 600&#x27;=1&quot; and is catalogued individually at: http://content.libraries.wsu.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/maps/id/329/rec/20. Named after a nearby creek at Union Flat, the town of Penawawa lay twelve miles west of Almota. Its first permanent settler, Mr. Ed Johnson, arrived in 1871 and raised cattle. In 1872, the territorial road running from Walla Walla to Colville stopped at the settlement and helped its economy greatly. It was platted in 1877 by founders Emsley Flincher, C.C. Cram and Francis Marion Byrd. Cram owned a ferry business on the other side of the Snake River and Penawawa grew as a ferry station and an exchange station that kept fresh horses for the stage coach route from Spokane to Pendleton. It was widely used until the highway was built and bypassed Penawawa for Central Ferry instead. There was also a railroad in the vicinity, located near Camas Prairie Road. The Penawawa post office was in existence from 1872 to 1937. Their school, which had begun sometime before 1890, consolidated with Colfax in 1940. The cemetery was also moved to Colfax (1960) due to the likelihood of water levels rising from construction (beginning 1963)of the Little Goose Dam.",

On verso: &quot;Sectional map Showing the Lands of Northern Pacific Railroad Co.&quot; text, and a large amount of details and specifics about Northern Pacific are also present. Originally folded to 23 x 12 cm. As a major part of the financing of its transcontinental routes, the Northern Pacific (and other railroads) were awarded large grants of land. Part of the Northern Pacific&#x27;s grant included alternating sections of land for forty miles to either side of their projected line. Much of this land had already been settled, and after the Supreme Court favored the settlers in the matter, Congress compensated the railroads with timbered lands elsewhere. Due to the size and condition of this map, it was scanned in two pieces which could not be evenly electronically recombined. As a result, the map is presented here in two pieces.",

Scale: not marked; approx. 1 inch = 24 miles (using Public Land Survey System). &quot;Traced by E.J.H. 1915.&quot; map folds up into a brochure entitled &quot;Map of the Olympic National Forest and Directions for Hunters and Campers,&quot; with information &quot;To the Public&quot; about recreating within the forest, including notes on health and fire prevention on reverse of map. map indicates monuments, ranger stations, hotels, telephone instruments, telephone lines, trails, railroads, and other public and government installments. There is an area hand-shaded in green pencil, and on both sides of the map is a handwritten letter: &quot;Please note extent of region with no roads, no trails, no settlements. Gray&#x27;s H. County is one of the oldest settled in the state, yet within an hour&#x27;s walk of any city, one can become lost in the wilderness. Gov&#x27;t reports speak highly of the soil, why so little land occupied in a county of 40,000 inhabitants? A million and a quarter acres, 80,000 cleared, not 30,000 intensely cultivated. 20,000 a year added to logged off area. &#x27;If you can&#x27;t get your children to school from where you are, you must move out, or I&#x27;ll cite you for contempt of court,&#x27; declared the judge. &#x27;No power on earth can keep them from having to move out,&#x27; said attorney Brewer of Hoquiam. And the whole state will be called on to help solve the problem of getting settlers, and roads after the timber off. Should the question be studied? Hoquiam district is 16 miles long, reaching into Polson&#x27;s timber, elk herds are often seen within nine miles of Hoqiuam. That is excellent soil, gov&#x27;t reports say. Why do not people make homes there? Better find out. Ocosta District, the south row of townships are in the famous &quot;North River&quot; timber belt. Elma District (in green). Consider the propositions of extension work, correspondence school facilities, for isolated families to be supplemented by the help of visiting teachers, as are employed for isolated families in Scandinavian countries. Mother would gladly use the material. The county as the limit of taxation, the county or state as the limit of administration. The county superintendent to be appointed none but trained rural school workers eligible. Or if elected, none but trained rural school people eligible.&quot; Author unknown.",

Map folds into a pamphlet entitled &quot;Economic Land Use Classification for Whitman County,&quot; and an explanation for how to use the map on verso of map. Land use class 1: &quot;Those farming in areas where full-time operators have received the highest incomes obtainable per farm in the United States.&quot; In 1944, the total capital per farm in economic land use class 1 was $60,000-$80,000, for family earnings of $10,000-$15,000, according to this pamphlet. Land use class 2: &quot;Farming areas where soil and topography combinations have resulted in better than average incomes per farm . . . but where these factors are measurably less than those in Economic Land Class 1.&quot; Total capital per farm was $30,000-$45,000; family earnings were between $6,000 and $8,000. Land use class 3: &quot;. . . average economic productivity for the northern part of the United States . . . sufficient for a model level of living . . . &quot; Total capital per farm was between $18,000 and $25,000; family earnings were $3,500-$5,000. Land use class 4: &quot;. . . marginal economic productivity . . . sufficient to maintain only small amounts of capital per farm.&quot; Total capital per farm was about $15,000 to $17,500; family earnings per farm were between $3,000 and $3,500 in 1944. Land use class 5: &quot;Submarginal farming areas with resource combinations which are distinctly below average in economic productivity and which, while they are used extensively in relation to neighboring areas in the same type of farming region, nevertheless, are used more intensively than is justified by their basic resources. Such areas have provided . . . insufficient income for even a modest living.&quot; Farms in economic land use class 5 generated about $5,000-$7,500 in total capital in 1944; total family earnings were about $2,000 on average. Land use class 6: &quot;Those areas in the United States not now being farmed because of low economic productivity for plow farming.&quot; Also contains information for choosing land from land use maps, statistics on farm mortgage failures in Washington for loans made between 1917 and 1932, and how to control erosion to save costs.

Legend denotes Swamp land, Lakes and streams, Contours (interval 50 feet), Roads and trails, Secondary roads, Reservation boundary, and National forest boundary. Topographic and cultural data for this map were obtained from field notes of a timber cruise and land classification conducted in 1915, 1916, and 1917. Transit and stadia were used for primary control but detail was obtained by hand level and steel tape or by foot pacing and aneroid barometer, two compass lines being run ten chains apart through each forty acre legal subdivision. Section corners were identified. The greater part of the field work was done under the immediate direction of C.R. Garvey, with F.M. Wilkes as chief topographer. J.P. Kinney, Chief Supervisor of Forests. This reservation lies west of the Willamette Meridian, Wash. Due to this map&#x27;s size and condition, it was scanned in two pieces which could not be electronically stitched back together without discontinuities. As a result the map is presented here as two adjacent disconnected pieces, right and left, with a slight overlap. What is spelled here as Quinaielt is more commonly spelled Quinault.",

This manuscript maps runs from the point where the Kettle River meets the Columbia River in the map&#x27;s top left corner down to the Spokane River at the very bottom edge. Natural and man-made landmarks are sketched in black ink; roads and trails are sketched in red. Mileages are indicated between points on roads. Structures are labeled with property owners, including &quot;Indian houses,&quot; Halfway House (between Kettle Falls and Colville), and salmon fishery at Kettle Falls. Page 79 of the Stevens County Commissioner&#x27;s Minutes Book A, dated Tuesday Feb. 5, 1867, relates the payment of $30 to Washington Hall for executing a map of the roads of Stevens County. While we can&#x27;t confirm this, it seems quite likely this is that map. The provenance of the map is unknown; we speculate it may have came in with, and been separated from, the W.P. Winans Papers (Cage 147).",

AUTHORITY Under the Fallout Shelter License or Privilege signed September 27, 1962 for Washington State University by Dr. C. Clement French, President; Kenneth Lonn, Whitman County Director of Civil Defense; and Stewart L. Pittman, United States Assistant Secretary of Defense (Civil Defense), 28 buildings on the campus were made available for temporary sheltering persons during and after any and every actual or impending attack. Under this agreement, the shelters are to be marked and stocked with such appropriate shelter equipment and stocks as may be determined necessary by the United States government. Acting under this agreement, the Whitman County Civil Defense has determined that the shelters are to be available in an emergency, when the proper warning has been issued, to all persons, resident or non~ resident, citizens or non-citizens. There is sufficient shelter for everyone in Whitman County. Persons who prefer not to use the buildings as shelters or who cannot reach them because of distance are urged to prepare their home shelters within their home or community. Full instructions may be obtained from Civil Defense Officials, Post Offices, or the City Clerk in Pullman.",

If you reside in Pullman, Tekoa, or Colfax, please use the shelter map for each of these cities. Each of these has public shelters within its limits for all residents.   2. All other residents of the county please refer to the county map. This map indicates which W.S.U. shelter zone serves your residence. Please use the W.S.U. zone indicated.   3. The shelters within each W.S.U. zone ore listed by the W.S.U. map. Use any shelter within the zone serving you.     Family Emergency Plan. The Family Emergency Plan shown below should take effect immediately upon hearing the attack warning signal. Fill out the chart so that each member of the family will know where to go and what to do in case of attack. Enter the names of all members of the family in the boxes at left. In the next two columns, write in the place for each person to go at any time. Use the shelter information from the maps, where applicable, to fill out this chart.      Please drive PROMPTLY and CAREFULLY to WSU zones serving your area.     Whitman County has public shelters for all residents. In addition, many residents have home protected space which they are advised to use rather than drive to Pullman. All residents choosing to improve their home protection space, please read carefully Chapter 5 of the enclosed booklet \"IN TIME OF EMERGENCY.\"     How To Improvise Shelter For Farm Animals.  Your barn or farm utility building will provide fallout shelter for your farm animals if prepared properly.   The safest area inside your barn is at the very center of the building. Place as much of your livestock and produce in that area as possible. The roof, sidewalls, and the hayloft of your barn will provide shielding from fallout for the animals inside. You can provide additional protection by piling dirt along the outside of your barn or building.    Water from wells or any covered receptacle is safe for animal use.   Feed and fodder stored under cover should be used first. If no other food is available, animals can be turned out to pasture after a few days.   You can obtain additional information from the County Agent's office that will help you decide what crops, pasturage, and methods will be best and safest to use.

KNOW THE ATTACK WARNING SIGNAL (See Chapter 3, page 17)   On outdoor warning devices, the Attack Warning Signal is a 3 to 5 minute wavering sound, or a series of short blasts on whistles or horns.   This signal means: An enemy attack against the United States has been detected. Take protective action. (This signal has no other meaning, and will be used for no other purpose.)   On warning, don't use the phone. Get information from radio.     Shelters are stocked with basic food, medicines, and water. Other supplies should be brought by each individual. (See Chapter 6, In Time of Emergency)     Do not use telephone. Turn on your radio     Colfax.  Walk to shelter. Avoid adding to traffic congestion.

(3) Then follow your family emergency plan to take shelter.   If you receive information that the United States is under attack, or that attack is probable, (attack warning) follow your family emergency plan for taking shelter as soon as possible. Such an attack warning may be given to you by siren, it will be a three to five minute wailing tone or short blasts.   In time of civil defense emergency, a number of radio broadcast stations would remain on the air to provide emergency information. Turn your radio dial to a station close to Whitman County that is broadcasting information on the emergency situation. When you go to your shelter, toke your transistor radio.
